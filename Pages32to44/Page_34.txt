STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Efterfølger" – carries discipleship weight; not mere admirer.
* "forsager Verden" – renunciation with pietistic depth, not simple withdrawal.
* "Trængsler" – tribulations in Pauline sense.
* "Herlighed" – eschatological glory, not fame.
* "salig" – salvation/blessedness, eternal beatitude.
* "Drift" – inward compulsion or divine impulse, not vague inclination.
* "Bestilling" – divine commission or calling.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with causal logic.
* Embedded biblical quotations woven into prose.
* Sermonic rhetorical questions.

Theological Hazards:

* Exclusivity of the way of the cross for salvation.
* Divine agency in making disciples effective.
* Pneumatology: the Spirit as operative power.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressing conscience.
* Warning against assuming Christianity’s power has faded.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "vandrer Korsets Vei" – idiom for cruciform discipleship (cf. Luke 9).
* "Menneskefisker" – biblical metaphor (Matt. 4:19).
* "nød dem til at komme ind" – Luke 14:23; moral urgency, not coercion.
* Banquet imagery from parables of the Great Supper.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: True discipleship manifests divine power.
* Claim: No salvation apart from the way of the cross.
* Explanation: Christ alone makes followers into fishers of people.
* Expansion: God implants saving zeal and teaches its exercise.
* Objection anticipated: Is this calling only for apostles?
* Rebuttal: God’s power and Spirit remain unchanged.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 9:23–24 – self-denial and cross-bearing.
* Matthew 4:19 – fishers of men.
* Luke 14:16–23 – Great Supper parable.
* Hebrews 12:2 – through suffering to glory.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity of walking the way of the cross preserved.
* Divine action emphasized over human initiative.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "salig" rendered consistently as "saved" / "salvation".
* "Herlighed" as "glory".
* "Aand" as "Spirit".

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fishing, banquet, journey, and house imagery retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between doubt and assurance preserved.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where argument accumulates.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Therefore, if any person ever truly becomes a follower of Jesus, one who leaves all things, denies self, renounces the world, takes up the cross and walks in the footsteps of Jesus through tribulations unto glory, then in this very fact the power of God is revealed in such a manner that one no longer marvels so greatly at the powers for work that unfold themselves in such a person’s life.

But is there any such true follower of Jesus among people now? Yes—if there is any true Christian, or anyone who truly shall be saved; for no one is saved except the one who walks the way of the cross unto salvation. And surely there are still some—also in our own days—who set their course toward heaven?

“Follow me,” says Jesus, “and I will make you a fisher of men.” Take note of his words; he does not say: follow me, and you will become a fisher of men; but rather: I will make you a fisher of men. Even for a follower of Jesus it does not happen of itself that one becomes a fisher of men; Jesus himself must make his followers into fishers of men.

And—God be praised—he does so. He gives his disciples this inward urging in their hearts, that they may have people saved, that they may bring more along with them on the way to heaven—more and always more; soul after soul must be given a share in the joy in God, for it is great enough for all; there is room, and again room, for guests at the Lord’s great supper, and again and again the Lord sends out his servants after more.

And Jesus does not merely give the desire to win souls; he also shows his disciples how it is to be done. He himself places the gracious invitation upon the tongues of his servants: Come, for now all things are prepared; come to the wedding feast! Go out into the streets and lanes of the city and gather them in! Go out to the crossroads and along the hedges and press them to come in, that my house may be filled!

Yes, that was indeed how it was in the old days, you think—but now, now surely there is no such commission for us? It was the apostles who were to be fishers of men, not we?

Well yes, it appears as though the power of Christianity has come to an end, and as though there are not many who wish to be fishers of men; yet the Lord’s power is still the same, and his Spirit is mighty as in former days, and even now he calls followers whom he will make into fishers of men.
