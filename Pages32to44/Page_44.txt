STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hedningerne / Hedenskabet" – carries biblical-missional weight; must not be softened to neutral "non-Christians".
* "Udsendinge" – more than messengers; apostolic/missionary sense.
* "Frimodighed" – spiritual boldness grounded in faith, not mere confidence.
* "Menighed" – ecclesiological term meaning the living body of believers, not an institution.
* "Forbedere" – intercessors; must retain prayerful, priestly nuance.
* "Selvhengivelse" – self-surrender, consecration.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with accumulative logic.
* Sermonic questions that function as exhortation, not inquiry.
* Parallel lists that must remain intact.

Theological Hazards:

* Warfare imagery (light vs. darkness, Satan’s bonds).
* Pneumatology: Holy Spirit as source of mission, church, fruit.
* Intercession as means God uses to preserve missionaries.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational address to conscience.
* Earnest, collective "we" rhetoric.
* Moral pressure toward prayer and sacrifice.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gaaet ud for os, i vort Sted" – substitutionary representation; missionaries act on behalf of the church.
* "holde deres Hænder oppe" – Exodus 17 echo (Moses’ uplifted hands).
* "træde Persekarret" – Isaiah 63 imagery; solitary labor under judgment imagery.
* "tjene i Krig paa sin egen Sold" – Pauline rhetorical question (1 Cor 9:7).
* "Aanden udøses" – Acts 2 / Joel 2 Pentecost language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Missionaries represent the church in spiritual warfare.
* Therefore, the church must support them through prayer.
* Prayer sustains missionaries and produces fruit among the heathen.
* True prayer necessarily includes prayer for material means.
* Prayer for means becomes prayer for congregational life.
* Congregation exists only through the Holy Spirit.
* Therefore, all mission prayer is ultimately prayer for the Holy Spirit.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Exodus 17 – uplifted hands in battle.
* Isaiah 63 – treading the winepress alone.
* 1 Corinthians 9:7 – soldier’s wages.
* Acts 2 – Pentecost outpouring.
* 1 John 1 – fellowship with the Father and the Son.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings, appeals, and exhortations must retain gravity and urgency. No softening of spiritual conflict or responsibility.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

"Skulde vi ikke," "kan," "maa" retain full moral necessity and obligation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Hedninger – heathen
* Menighed – congregation
* Aand / Helligaand – Spirit / Holy Spirit
* Frugt – fruit

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

Military, agricultural, and bodily metaphors must remain vivid and unflattened.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

Severity (warfare, darkness) balanced with hope (fruit, Spirit, joy).

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

Sentence rhythm preserved for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Those who are sent out with God’s Gospel to the heathen have gone out for us, in our stead, into the great conflict for the Kingdom of God; how then should we not support them? Can a people forget the soldiers who risk their lives in the struggle against the enemies of the people—does it not bear them and uphold them in every way? So neither can the children of God leave the solitary men and women who labor as light in the darkness of heathendom standing forsaken in their work and their struggle. Let us uphold their hands—yes, their very souls, their courage, their strength, their willingness, and their self-surrender—through our believing prayers.

These our envoys should not have to spend their strength alone; nor should they be alone in treading the winepress, so that they would have to lament that there was no one who helped, and none who supported. No, these champions in the war of light against darkness should feel and perceive that there stands behind them a great host of intercessors who, with sympathy and love, follow them upon their toilsome path. This would hold up their hands and preserve their boldness. Therefore it would also grant them fruit from their labor, so that they themselves might be preserved from falling under the power of darkness, and that heathen might be delivered from Satan’s bonds and chains and be led into the Kingdom of God and into the fellowship that is in the light with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.

To this prayer for the missionaries and their work and its rich fruit among the heathen there belongs

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textsc{Prayer for Means}
\end{center}
\medskip

for the carrying out of the heathen mission. For it costs something to carry on heathen mission, and surely there is no one who thinks that our envoys should bear the expenses alone? Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Or should the congregation of God choose as missionaries only such men and women as themselves possess the means to sustain both themselves and their work? No, the means for the missionaries’ support—for churches and schools, for houses and textbooks—where shall they come from if not from God through the voluntary hand of his children? Let us therefore pray that God would give means for all our mission work; and when we thus pray, let us consider that in truth we are praying to receive ourselves the blessed gift of sacrificial willingness. The true mission prayer therefore becomes also

\medskip
\begin{center}
\textsc{Prayer for Congregation}
\end{center}
\medskip

for congregation is precisely that body of Christ on earth which, through the Spirit, is united with the Head, Christ, and therefore also equipped with the power of Christ and the love of Christ, so that it with both joy and strength does his work and goes on his errand.

There is first real earnestness in mission work when we truly become congregation—that is, when Christ pours out his Spirit upon us—so that it becomes as on that first Pentecost day, when the Spirit came and tongues were loosed, and they all spoke of the mighty works of God in the various languages.

And even if we must pray for many things in our mission prayer, we nevertheless conclude where we began and say: all mission prayer is indeed, in truth, prayer for the Holy Spirit. If only it might become truly living among us, then we would receive both men and means and rich fruit of the work, both abroad and at home.

Ask, and it shall be given to you.
