STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Aanden” – must be rendered as “the Spirit,” with theological and biblical weight, not a generic ‘spirit’.
* “Missionsbønnen” – a technical devotional term meaning the church’s prayer for mission; must remain concrete and ecclesial.
* “Høstens Herre” – biblical title for God (Matt. 9:38); must retain scriptural resonance.
* “udd rive Arbeidere” – carries force of divine compulsion (“thrust forth”); not a mild ‘send’.
* “Menighed” – should be “congregation,” not a vague ‘community’.
* “Hjertelag” – denotes disposition of heart, willingness, spiritual attitude.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with causal flow must not be broken into short modern clauses.
* Parallel prayer formulas (“Send mig! send mig!”) must retain repetition and urgency.
* Transitional pivots (“Men ikke det alene”) must remain rhetorically marked.

Theological Hazards:

* Calling to ministry as divine action of the Spirit, not human volunteering.
* Purification imagery (fire from the altar) tied to forgiveness and liberation from fear (Isaiah 6).
* Interdependence of individual calling and congregational obedience.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience and responsibility.
* Warnings against prayerless mission must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “lade al Tanke og Omhu fare” – idiom meaning to abandon thought and care; must retain moral seriousness.
* “mange Suk” – biblical/pietistic language for inward groanings in prayer (Rom. 8).
* “træde ind i Rækkerne” – military/processional metaphor for joining the ranks.
* Isaiah’s “Se, her er jeg, send mig!” – direct biblical quotation (Isa. 6:8).
* Moses’ “Send en anden!” – allusion to Exod. 4; reluctance before calling.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Clarification: prayer is not reduced to a single word or concept.
* Definition: mission prayer encompasses multiple works of the Spirit.
* First petition of mission prayer: missionaries.
* Assertion: missionaries without prayer are illegitimate.
* Individual calling illustrated by Isaiah and Moses.
* Necessity of purification and grace preceding true willingness.
* Congregational calling illustrated by Antioch (Acts 13).
* Parallel between true missionary and true missionary congregation.
* Expansion: sending alone is insufficient; ongoing prayer is required.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 9:38 – “the Lord of the harvest.”
* Isaiah 6:6–8 – altar fire, removal of sin, “Here am I; send me.”
* Exodus 4 – Moses’ reluctance.
* Acts 13 – Antioch, prayer and fasting, Paul and Barnabas.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain urgency and moral necessity of prayer.
* Preserve warning against careless or merely organizational mission.
* Keep the exhortational pressure on both individual and congregation.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “maa” – rendered as “must,” not “should.”
* “kan” in negative constructions must retain impossibility.
* Imperative prayers (“Send mig!”) must remain forceful.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aanden → the Spirit
* Synd → sin
* Naade → grace
* Bøn → prayer
* Menighed → congregation

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fire from the altar retained as image, not explained away.
* Harvest imagery preserved.
* Sending imagery kept concrete and active.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Gentle assurance (God delights in many prayers) vs. stern warning (prayerless mission).
* Fear contrasted with liberation through grace.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long, accumulating sentences.
* Preserve repetition and climactic prayer formulas.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

But this does not mean that, either in mission prayer or in any other prayer, we should mention only this one word—the Spirit—and then let all thought and care fall away. God is well pleased to hear his children’s many sighs and to listen to their many prayers.

The mission prayer comprises several different workings of the Spirit; it also asks for the Spirit’s gift for more than a single person. When we pray for mission, then it is surely one of the first things we pray for that the Lord of the harvest will thrust workers into his great harvest. In other words, the mission prayer is first

Missionaries who are obtained without prayer are not of the right kind. First and foremost, the one who is to become a missionary must be driven and led by the Spirit of God to pray with Isaiah: Here am I; send me! It often goes so that the Lord’s first call to the one who is to become a missionary is met with Moses’ fearful prayer: Lord, send another! But it does not become true earnestness until the fire from the altar has burned away both sin and fear…, so that the one who has himself experienced the great grace that his sin is taken away is also freed from fear, so that he both must and dares to pray: Send me! send me!

But not that alone. All who wish to have a missionary to send, every congregation that wishes to step into the ranks of the mission-sending congregations, must follow in the footsteps of the congregation in Antioch, which received Paul and Barnabas as its missionaries through prayer and fasting (Acts 13).

Just as only that one becomes a true missionary who prays: Lord, send me! so only that becomes a true mission-sending congregation which prays: Lord, use me and what is mine in your service, so that I may have a part in sending out missionaries. Give us men to send and hearts to send them!

But not everything is done by sending out missionaries. Think if we only sent them and did not pray for them! That would become a dangerous mission. Therefore the mission prayer is also
