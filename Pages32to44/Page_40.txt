STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Disciple" (discipel): carries biblical office and relational weight; avoid flattening to "follower".
* "Skatte" / "Skat": both literal and metaphorical; includes spiritual reward and relational joy.
* "den urette Mammon": fixed biblical phrase (Luke 16); must not be modernized to mere "money".
* "annamme": receive/welcome; older term with covenantal hospitality nuance.
* "Boliger": Johannine eschatological dwelling; avoid generic "homes".
* "Herlighedens Rige": kingdom of glory; theological eschatology term.
* "Lammets Bryllup" / "den himmelske Nadver": Revelation imagery; preserve sacramental resonance.
* "Opoffrelse": sacrificial giving; not mere inconvenience.
* "Værdier": here moral/spiritual investments, not abstract worth.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with causal pivots.
* Rhetorical questions guiding conscience.
* Parallel constructions ("ikke … men …").
* Enumerations across clauses that should not be split.

Theological Hazards:

* Relationship between earthly stewardship and heavenly reward.
* Doctrine of reward without merit-theology.
* Mission (Hedningemissionen) as instrument, not human glory.
* Eternal joy grounded in redeemed persons, not abstract crowns.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran earnestness.
* Pastoral pressure on conscience.
* Danger of softening paradox (losing/keeping).

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Gjører eder Venner ved den urette Mammon": Luke 16:9; idiom for stewarding temporal goods toward eternal ends.
* "naar I skilles herfra": death; euphemistic but solemn.
* "samles fra Nord og Syd, fra Øst og Vest": Matt. 8:11 / Luke 13:29; eschatological ingathering.
* "Skare efter Skare": biblical crowd imagery (Rev. 7).
* "mister det, vi beholder": paradoxical aphorism; must remain sharp.
* KJV parallels helpful in cadence but pronouns must be modern.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Jesus wills not only salvation but joy-filled heavenly treasure for his disciples.
* Clarification via Scripture (Luke 16).
* Definition of heavenly treasure as grateful redeemed persons.
* Application: place of heathen missions.
* Eschatological vision as motivation.
* Cost-benefit evaluation of sacrifice.
* Paradox of loss and gain.
* Practical exhortation: imitate earthly treasure-gatherers.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 16:9 – unrighteous mammon.
* Matthew 6:20 – treasures in heaven (implicit).
* Matthew 8:11 / Luke 13:29 – ingathering from four corners.
* Revelation 19 – Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
* Revelation 7 – crowds before the throne.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain exhortational force and eschatological urgency.
* No sentimental softening of joy or sacrifice.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity in "vil" (wills), "maa" (must), "kan" contrasts.
* Maintain rhetorical questions as demands on conscience.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Disciple – disciple
* Skat/Skatte – treasure/treasures
* Frelste – the saved / redeemed
* Rige – kingdom
* Ofre/Opoffrelse – sacrifice

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Treasury imagery.
* Investment/yield paradox.
* Gathering crowds imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Wonder → exhortation → warning → encouragement.
* Maintain contrast between earthly and heavenly accounting.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences where accumulation is intentional.
* Maintain sermon-like rhythm and pivots.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

But Jesus wills that his disciples should not only attain heaven, but that they should also find treasures there—treasures which they have gathered during their life on earth. What can he mean by this? Is it not the same thing he says elsewhere: Make for yourselves friends by means of the unrighteous mammon, so that, when you depart from here, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings?

It will surely not be all the treasures, nor the whole treasure; yet it is certain that it will be a glorious treasure, one that will gladden one for all eternity, if there are found friends in the world to come who are bound to us in this present world through the deeds, small or great, which we were able to show one another here below by means of earthly resources.

And Jesus, who wills that his disciples should have all the joy and blessedness that human hearts are capable of holding, therefore counsels them precisely for this reason to gather for themselves treasures in heaven—such treasures as consist in the joyful gratitude of redeemed people.

And here too the mission to the heathen has its place. It is one of the ways in which the unrighteous mammon can be used to gather treasures in heaven.

It will indeed be a true heavenly joy of the right kind, when we are granted the sight of the redeemed entering into the kingdom of glory, and when they are gathered from north and south, from east and west, to the marriage supper of the Lamb and the heavenly feast.

To see them—multitude after multitude—come forward to their place before the throne, and among them to recognize the friends we had gained, and the souls we had won, while we were on earth—how glorious and uplifting this will be!

And when the redeemed from among the heathen come forward, then to meet those for whom we prayed, and those for whom we sacrificed—will not that be worth all the sacrifice that it cost us to send them the Savior’s gospel? Indeed, no one will regret that he gathered such treasures in heaven. The possessions we leave behind on earth are those which were not sacrificed; the possessions we find again, a thousandfold refined and transfigured in heaven, are precisely those which were sacrificed for the cause of God and of his kingdom. For in this it is indeed true that we lose what we keep; but we gain for eternity what we sacrifice.

But how do we become diligent and good gatherers of treasure? Yes, we can learn that from those who gather treasures on earth. They do not ask, How little can I get by with? but they ask, How much—oh how much—can I lay aside in the treasury? How much can I put together this week, this month, or this year? In the same way must Christians also think about their treasures in heaven: not, How little can I get by with, but, How much can I lay up. That is true zeal in the gathering of treasure.
