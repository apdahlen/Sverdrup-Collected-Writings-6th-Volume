STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Myndighed" — not mere authority in office, but intrinsic divine authority; must not be weakened.
* "Forjættelse" — biblical promise; avoid generic "assurance".
* "Bønhørelse" — answered prayer; retain the relational and covenantal sense.
* "Uselhed" — worthlessness / insufficiency; avoid psychological self-esteem language.
* "Nidkjærhed" — zeal with moral and spiritual intensity, not mere enthusiasm.
* "Hellig Aand" — Holy Spirit; doctrinal precision required.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with causal flow and sermonic cadence must not be broken up unnecessarily.
* Parallelisms and accumulative clauses create theological pressure.
* Quoted phrases (“udvortes Strid, indvortes Frygt”) must retain rhythm and contrast.

Theological Hazards:

* Prayer as grounded in God’s will, not human initiative.
* Mission framed as spiritual warfare (“hellige Krig”).
* Doctrine of the Holy Spirit as the supreme gift.
* Human inability versus divine efficacy.

Voice Hazards:

* Risk of softening exhortation into reflection.
* Risk of modern devotional tone replacing Lutheran earnestness.
* Must preserve address to conscience and communal responsibility.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Beder, saa skal eder gives” — direct Matt. 7:7 citation; best rendered close to KJV cadence but with modern pronouns.
* “Han talte som den, der havde Myndighed” — Matt. 7:29 echo; authority inherent, not delegated.
* “udvortes Strid, indvortes Frygt” — 2 Cor. 7:5; preserve antithetical balance.
* “Ti, vær stille!” — Mark 4:39; Christ’s sovereign word calming chaos.
* “hellige Krig” — pietistic-missional metaphor; must not be diluted into mere effort.
* “Sum-men af alt det” — rhetorical summation; keep logical force.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: Christ’s words uniquely grant peace because of divine authority.
* Illustration: His authority in promise parallels His authority over nature.
* Application: The promise of answered prayer grounds missionary courage.
* Problem: Awareness of obstacles produces despair and self-knowledge.
* Pivot: Necessity of missionary prayer.
* Doctrinal clarification: All true prayer according to God’s will culminates in prayer for the Holy Spirit.
* Conclusion: The Spirit is the source of missionaries, perseverance, fruit, and congregational zeal.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 7:7 — Ask, and it shall be given you.
* Matthew 7:29 — Teaching with authority.
* 2 Corinthians 7:5 — Without were fightings, within were fears.
* Mark 4:39 — Peace, be still.
* Luke 11:13 — The Holy Spirit as the supreme gift.
* Great Commission (implicit) — Gospel to all nations.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain seriousness of spiritual struggle.
* Preserve weight of human inadequacy.
* Maintain urgency of prayer as indispensable.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “behøver” → must / have need of.
* “kan” and “ingen” constructions must preserve impossibility.
* Avoid conditional softening.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forjættelse → promise
* Hellig Aand → Holy Spirit
* Mission → mission (capitalized when theological weight is intended)
* Menigheden → the congregation

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Storm imagery retained.
* Warfare language preserved without apology.
* Fruit-bearing language kept biblical.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Consolation from Christ’s word.
* Despair from self-knowledge.
* Hope and urgency through the Spirit.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences where exhortation builds.
* Preserve pauses through commas and semicolons.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\subsection{Mission Prayer}

\begin{quote}
Ask, and it shall be given you! Matt. 7:7.
\end{quote}

How good it is to hear the words of Jesus, for no human being has ever spoken like this. He spoke as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. And precisely this authority—how comforting it is! What Jesus says stands so firm, and gives the soul such assurance and peace. And especially when his promises come to us in troubled hours, when there is “conflict without and fear within,” then this calm and elevation of his become a refreshing rest for the soul and work in the same manner as his mighty word to the storm and the raging waves: Peace, be still.

So it is also with this promise concerning answered prayer: Ask, and it shall be given you! No human being speaks of prayer in this way; for no one knows the Father’s mind and the Father’s power as the Son does.

And we need it deeply in connection with our missionary work. For when we look at the many difficulties that place themselves in the way of this “holy war” against Satan’s dominions and the power of darkness, then we feel deeply our own impotence and worthlessness; and despondency settles upon the soul, so that we are almost ready to give up everything, because we are fit for nothing.

Therefore missionary prayer is for us such a vital matter that we can scarcely exercise ourselves enough in it, and become both more capable and more zealous in it from day to day.

And now it is, of course, self-evident to all spiritually enlightened Christians that the sum of all that we ask according to God’s good and pleasing will is the prayer for the Holy Spirit. Jesus himself has made it entirely clear to his disciples that the Holy Spirit is the best gift, the true gift, the gift above all gifts for the children of God. Thus missionary prayer also is, in its inmost essence, precisely a prayer for God’s Holy Spirit. For he is the one who raises up missionaries, who drives them out into the work, who upholds them in the task and gives them fruit from their labor; he is also the one who fills the congregation with zeal and holy ardor in this cause, so that it gives itself no rest until it has sent forth the Gospel of the Kingdom to all peoples.
