STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Skattesamlere" as moral category, not tax collectors.
* "Hjerte" as seat of will, love, and orientation, not emotion only.
* "fordærver" implies decay and corruption.
* "hoiferfærdigt Levnet" = proud, arrogant mode of life.
* "Salighed" = blessedness/salvation, not mere happiness.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with causal chaining.
* Biblical quotations embedded into prose.
* Parallel contrasts (earthly/heavenly; world/God).

Theological Hazards:

* Treasure-heart relationship (Matt 6).
* World-love vs Father’s love (1 John 2).
* Eternal consequences determined by love.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation to conscience.
* Didactic pastoral tone must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Samler eder Skatte" – exhortational imperative; KJV resonance.
* "Bevar dit Hjerte" – moral vigilance.
* "Verden" – fallen order opposed to God.
* "Kjødets Lyst, Øinenes Lyst" – 1 John 2 echoes.
* Magnet needle metaphor common in devotional prose.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Scriptural command to seek heavenly treasure.
* Explanation of heart’s decisive role.
* Danger of earthly attachment.
* Benefit of heavenly-mindedness.
* Apostolic confirmation (1 John).
* Psychological observation of love’s fixation.
* Contrast between worldly and God-bound hearts.
* Eschatological conclusion (rich man and Lazarus).

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 6:20–21
* Proverbs 4:23
* 1 John 2:15–17
* Luke 16:19–31 (Rich Man and Lazarus)

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain warning against worldliness.
* Preserve inevitability of consequence.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Imperatives remain imperatives.
* No weakening of necessity or outcome.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Hjerte = heart
* Verden = world
* Salighed = blessedness

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Magnet needle metaphor retained.
* Treasure-heart imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning → instruction → consolation → judgment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where logic accumulates.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\subsection{Treasure Collectors}

\begin{quote}
Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.  Matthew 6:20.
\end{quote}

Guard your heart, says the wise man, above all else that you guard; for from it life proceeds (Proverbs 4:23). And Jesus also gives us to understand the worth of the heart, when he counsels us not to gather treasures on earth, but in heaven, because “where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”

Earthly treasures are so dangerous and perishable because they draw the heart downward and bind it to this earth and to the present world.

Heavenly treasures have so beneficent an effect, because they help to make us heavenly-minded and to lift the heart toward the unseen and eternal things.

And this may help us see the matter still more clearly when we read John’s exhortation in his First Epistle: Do not love the world, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desire of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not from the Father, but from the world. And the world passes away, and its desire; but the one who does the will of God abides for eternity.

That which the heart loves and clings to occupies the heart day and night. Thought and desire always turn back to it, when for a brief while one has been compelled to think of something else.

They are strong bonds that bind the miser’s heart to his wealth, or the ambitious and vain to his greatness, or the pleasure-loving to his enjoyments. It is all the same what may for a moment disturb those who love the world in their love and enjoyment: involuntarily the heart nevertheless turns back to the beloved object and dwells upon it. In labor and in rest, by day and by night, at home or in church, the heart nonetheless always returns to its treasure.

And so it is likewise with the one whose heart is bound to the Lord with eternal love. Even if the world intrudes and disturbs, and even if labor and daily toil demand attention, in the innermost depth of the heart the direction remains the same. And as the magnetic needle points toward the pole, so the heavenly-minded heart always turns back to God and his eternal love, because only there is blessedness.

And by this are life and death determined. Think of the rich man and Lazarus! The love of the heart determined their eternal and unchangeable destiny.
