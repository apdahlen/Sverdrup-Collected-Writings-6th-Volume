\section{The Salt of the Earth}

\begin{quote}
You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its power, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. Matthew 5:13.
\end{quote}

Jesus prayed for his disciples in this manner: I do not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil. This prayer of Jesus concerns precisely the same matter as his testimony in the Sermon on the Mount: You are the salt of the earth—namely, the serious calling which the Lord has given to his believers, the responsible position in which he has placed them in the world, a position that entails such great dangers for themselves that only by the grace of God can they be preserved, so that they themselves may be saved.

The salt of the earth is the name given to believers in contrast to the corruption which, through sin, is in the world. Yet this corruption does not consist precisely in coarse vices; rather, it consists first and foremost in this, that earthly, sensuous, and perishable things are the measure of human imagining and desiring. Paul describes this corruption, or rottenness, in this way: Many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ; whose end is destruction, whose god is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their mind on earthly things.

See, this is precisely the matter. Spiritual death, which is separation from God, has spiritual corruption as its immediate consequence. But spiritual death is found exactly where the soul desires only earthly things and the satisfaction of the senses.

But this is merely another name for paganism; for Jesus himself says: after all such things the Gentiles seek—namely food and drink and clothing; for them this is the whole goal of life, nothing else has value for them.

It is told of a guest who was asked whether he knew the Lord’s Prayer, that at first he answered no, saying that he had forgotten it; but when the missionary asked whether he remembered nothing of it at all, he finally broke out: Give us today our daily bread! That he had not forgotten. And this is characteristic of the great multitude of pagans: they have sense for food and drink, but what dullness, indifference, and incapacity to receive, when it comes to questions concerning that which is spiritual.

When therefore Jesus says of his disciples: You are the salt of the earth, he thereby designates a high and holy task, a calling which he gives them, for which they are by no means fit of themselves or by their own fleshly nature. For by nature they were children of the world, just like all the others.

It is only life that helps against death; it is only spiritual life that helps against spiritual death. It is only by passing over from death to life that anyone becomes salt in the sense of which Jesus here speaks. There can be no question of rescuing or preserving the spiritually dead from corruption except through life itself. When therefore the word sounds forth to those who in our day are called Christians, it becomes, surely, for all who still have something of genuine seriousness left in their souls, a sharply testing word—this: You are the salt of the earth.
