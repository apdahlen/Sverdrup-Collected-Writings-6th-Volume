STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "døende eller døde" – must preserve the stark spiritual finality; not merely metaphorical weakness.
* "Saltet" – biblical metaphor (Matt. 5); must retain sacramental seriousness.
* "hengives, opgives, opofres" – overlapping verbs of surrender; avoid collapsing into one.
* "tærres hen" – gradual consumption; not sudden destruction.
* "Fordervelse" – theological ruin, not mere decay.
* "Menighed" – ecclesial body, not generic community.
* "Kald og Kors" – vocational calling bound to suffering; avoid abstraction.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Rhetorical questions that press the conscience; must remain interrogative.
* Long cumulative sentences with semicolon pivots.
* Embedded Pauline quotation requiring scriptural cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Gospel applied to the spiritually dead.
* Self-giving unto death as the means by which Christ’s life is manifested.
* Ecclesial judgment paralleling the world’s judgment.
* Resurrection logic tied to participation in Christ’s death.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational pressure must not be softened.
* The preacher’s direct address (“du,” “eder,” “os”) must remain.
* Earnest warning balanced with final consolation.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Saltet kommer i aller-nærmeste Berørelse" – idiom for intimate, costly engagement; echoes Matt. 5:13.
* "Jorden faar ikke Gavn" – earth as the field of humanity; agricultural-biblical frame.
* Pauline citation: 2 Corinthians 4:11 – must follow biblical logic and rhythm.
* Wheat grain saying: John 12:24–25 – retain paradox and inevitability.
* "stifter den sig lige med Verden" – aligning oneself; covenantal infidelity language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening rebuke: distance from the dying negates gospel vocation.
* Metaphor expansion: salt must be expended to preserve life.
* Apostolic confirmation: Paul as doctrinal warrant.
* Warning to individual and church: refusal of death leads to decay and judgment.
* Christological foundation: wheat grain law of life.
* Final exhortation and promise: resurrection and eternal life for the self-given.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 5:13 – salt of the earth.
* 2 Corinthians 4:11 – given over to death for Jesus’ sake.
* John 12:24–25 – wheat grain dying to bear fruit.
* Implicit Romans 8 participation-in-Christ logic.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp interrogatives.
* Preserve warnings without mitigation.
* Allow consolation only after the full weight of the call.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / necessity rendered as "must" or logical inevitability.
* Conditional warnings remain absolute, not hypothetical.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Liv / Død – Life / Death (capitalized where theological).
* Menighed – Church or congregation (consistent).
* Hengives – given over / delivered over (consistent).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Salt consumed to preserve.
* Wheat grain dying to multiply.
* Life withering when refusing the cross.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity → warning → promise → consolation.
* Do not equalize emotional register.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences for proclamation.
* Maintain rhythmic parallelism and breath pauses.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

What do you do then? Do you bring the Gospel to the dying or to the dead? See, this is precisely what is required: that the salt comes into the closest possible contact with that which is to be salted. Why then do you keep yourself so far away? Why do you stand at a distance?

The earth receives no benefit from the salt unless it is used, unless it is given over, surrendered, sacrificed. If it is a great task, then surely it is also a painful task. It is as Paul says: We who live are continually given over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be made manifest in our mortal flesh.

This is the nature of the salt. It is used up; it is worn away; yet it preserves and rescues and saves life, and it has accomplished its work.

But if you do not dare to enter the struggle of life against death, then the danger is great. If the Church does not dare to take up its calling and its cross, then its own life withers and languishes. And if it aligns itself with the world, then it falls under the same judgment and corruption as the world.

Therefore this is the condition of life for Jesus’ disciples and his Church: Truly, truly I say to you: Unless the grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Whoever loves his life will lose it, and whoever hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.

Let us therefore no longer fear being consumed in the Lord’s service and in the labor of his love. He who himself gave his life over to death and was gloriously raised from it—he will also grant to those who are given over to death for his sake a glorious resurrection and a blessed entrance into eternal life.
