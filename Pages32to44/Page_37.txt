STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Overgangne fra Døden til Livet – biblical phrase (1 John 3:14); must retain forensic–existential force, not mere moral improvement.
* Fordervelse – corruption/decay with moral and ontological weight; not merely “immorality.”
* Begjærlig-hed – lust/concupiscence; carries Pauline nuance.
* Kjærlighedens Liv – life constituted by divine love, not emotional affection.
* Aand – Spirit; clearly God’s Spirit, not human spirit.
* Raaddenhed – rottenness/putrefaction; vivid image of decay.
* Salt – metaphor from Matthew 5; moral–preservative force.
* Hedenskabet – heathenism/pagan world; 19th-century missional category.
* Trældom – bondage/slavery; strong soteriological term.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long interrogative chains building cumulative self-examination.
* Sermonic parallelism and rhetorical repetition (“Er vi…?”).
* Embedded biblical clauses that must remain intact.
* Semicolon and comma logic that must not be flattened.

Theological Hazards:

* Distinction between nominal Christianity and true participation in Christ’s life.
* Doctrine of spiritual death and life.
* Ecclesiology: congregation as Christ’s body and salt of the earth.
* Missionary scope of the Church’s calling.
* Christ’s victory over death and the devil (Hebrews 2:14–15).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation aimed at conscience.
* Severe self-examination without consolation being sentimentalized.
* Collective address (“we”) that implicates the hearer.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Overgangne fra Døden til Livet” – Johannine idiom; KJV resonance: “passed from death unto life.”
* “Kristi Korses Fiender” – Pauline phrase (Phil. 3:18); enemies defined by opposition to the cross’s power.
* “Salt” – Matt. 5:13; preservative, purifying, arresting decay.
* “Synden og Døden iveien” – standing in the way of sin and death; blocking their advance.
* “Kjøber den beleilige Tid” – Eph. 5:16 / Col. 4:5; redeeming the time.
* “Ordets Lys” – light of God’s Word as judge and revealer.
* “Hvad salter du?” – idiomatic challenge: where is your preserving influence felt?
* “Hedenskabet” – world untouched by the gospel.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis framed as searching questions: Have we truly passed from death to life?
* Contrast between true life in the Spirit and nominal Christianity.
* Ecclesial self-examination: Are we truly salt?
* Application of biblical metaphors (speech, conduct, wisdom toward outsiders).
* Intensification: the congregation tested in the light of the Word.
* Partial consolation: some truly live and fight for life.
* Expansion of calling: the scope of the Church’s influence is the whole earth.
* Missional pivot toward heathendom as realm of death.
* Christological foundation: Christ’s victory over death and the devil.
* Concluding affirmation of faith in the gospel as medicine against death.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* 1 John 3:14 – passing from death to life.
* 2 Peter 1:4 – corruption in the world through lust.
* Matthew 5:13 – salt of the earth.
* Colossians 4:6 – speech seasoned with salt.
* Colossians 4:5 / Ephesians 5:16 – walking wisely, redeeming the time.
* 1 Corinthians 12 – Christ’s body.
* Hebrews 2:14–15 – Christ destroying the power of death and the devil.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp interrogatives and uncompromising moral scrutiny.
* Do not soften accusations against nominal Christianity.
* Preserve missionary urgency and global scope.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “maa,” “skal,” implied necessity retained as moral and divine obligation.
* Rhetorical questions must retain pressure, not become reflective musings.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Døden – Death (capitalized when personified).
* Livet – Life (capitalized when theological).
* Synd – Sin.
* Aand – Spirit (God’s Spirit).
* Menighed – Congregation/Church (contextually).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Salt, decay, death/life, light, bondage, healing preserved as images.
* No explanatory paraphrase in place of metaphor.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severe self-examination → brief consolation → renewed challenge.
* Do not level severity and hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and cumulative clauses.
* Maintain rhythm suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Are we so? Yes—are we truly so? Have we passed from Death to Life? Have we come out of that corruption which is in the world through lust, and entered into that life of love which is wrought by God’s Spirit, and which in itself is mighty to endure eternally and has power to draw others with it out of Death and into Life?

For surely all who are willing to see can see that many bear the name of Christ and yet are nevertheless enemies of the cross of Christ, and with all their might help to promote spiritual death and rottenness among human beings.

But we do not merely call ourselves Christians in the sense that we live in a Christian land; we call ourselves a congregation and children of God, holy and beloved, chosen and precious to God. Are we then also salt? Is it felt and does it show in our life that we stand in the way of Sin and Death? Is a power of Life recognized in our speech and in our conduct? Is it as the apostle says: Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each one? Do we walk wisely toward those who are outside, so that we redeem the opportune time?

Truly, it becomes a hard self-examination for the congregation when it must come forth into the light of the Word and ask itself: Am I Christ’s body? Do I live his life, and do I do his work? Yet this is indeed the meaning of this word: You are the salt of the earth.

But—God be praised—even if they are ever so few, there are nevertheless some who have passed from Death to Life, and who stand manfully in the work and the struggle for Life.

Yet even then this question arises: What do you salt? How far does your influence reach? Jesus says: the salt of the earth—the earth. So far must the influence of the congregation reach. It does not stop at family or circle of friends, nor at the boundaries of the local congregation, nor at the fatherland or our own nation. Further onward and farther out the calling goes. As far as Death goes, Life must attempt to set things right. Is that not the meaning?

But where do Sin and Death reign more undisturbed, more absolutely, than out in heathendom? And you believe in him who through death rendered powerless the one who had the power of death—that is, the devil—and who thereby intended to set free those who through fear of death were held in bondage all their lifetime. You believe in the Overcomer of Death; you believe that the gospel of Jesus is a healing remedy against Death.
