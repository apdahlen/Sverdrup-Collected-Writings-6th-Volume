STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hedningemissionen" – carries 19th‑century Lutheran missionary theology; must not be reduced to neutral "foreign missions" but retain the soteriological urgency of salvation of the heathen.
* "gjerriges" – moral term with strong ethical condemnation; not merely "stingy" but spiritually corrupted attachment to wealth.
* "omsa[t]" – metaphor of exchange; risks flattening into modern financial language.
* "Evner" – not skills alone, but God‑given capacities entrusted for stewardship.
* "forsaget" – ascetical renunciation with spiritual cost, not mere inconvenience.
* "Boliger" – biblical term echoing John 14; must retain eschatological resonance.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with causal clauses must not be fragmented.
* Repeated conditional constructions ("om vi … saa vilde") create sermonic logic.
* Exhortational imperatives embedded within reflective prose.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of heavenly treasure (Matt 6:20) as real participation in God’s kingdom, not metaphorical encouragement.
* Salvation of souls as concrete increase of the redeemed, not symbolic growth.
* Love (Kjærlighed) as the one true portion of the heart (Luke 10:42 echo).
* Resurrection of the dead as recompense, not vague afterlife reward.

Voice Hazards:

* Risk of modern motivational tone replacing earnest pastoral exhortation.
* Danger of softening absolute self‑surrender language.
* Losing sermonic rhythm and moral pressure upon the reader’s conscience.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "se det i dette Lys" – means to perceive spiritually; best rendered "see it in this light" with theological weight.
* "frembære vore Gaver" – cultic language of offering; echoing sacrificial imagery.
* "agte paa" – attentive watching with care, not casual interest.
* "Livet i Bønnen" – prayer enlivened by faith’s vision, not emotional enthusiasm.
* "ikke min egen" – Romans 14:8 / 1 Corinthians 6:19 echo; total belonging to Christ.
* "Evigheders Evighed" – biblical superlative (Rev 1:6); must be retained in elevated diction.

King James parallels:

* Matthew 6:20 – "Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven"
* Luke 16:9 – "everlasting habitations"
* Luke 10:42 – "that good part"

Literal translation risks:

* Reducing eschatological exchange to metaphorical "investment."
* Diluting resurrection reward into generic spiritual satisfaction.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening conditional vision: if we truly saw rightly, our attitude to missions would be transformed.
* Contrast between greedy joy over wealth and pure joy over giving.
* Consequence: renewed prayer, labor, and generosity grounded in heavenly accounting.
* Central command: Christ’s imperative to store treasure in heaven.
* Call to total consecration of person and possessions.
* Concluding promise: freedom, happiness, love, resurrection joy, and eternal welcome.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 6:20 – storing treasure in heaven.
* Luke 10:42 – the good part that shall not be taken away.
* Luke 16:9 – welcomed into eternal dwellings.
* Romans 14:8 / 1 Corinthians 6:19 – not one’s own, belonging to the Lord.
* John 14:2 – many dwellings.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain earnest exhortation without sentimental appeal.
* Preserve warning against self‑deception regarding sacrifice.
* Retain weight of eternal consequence and joy.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vilde" / "skulde" – conditional inevitability, not mere possibility.
* Imperatives ("Samler eder") must remain commands, not advice.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Guds Rige – "the Kingdom of God" consistently.
* Skatte – "treasures" consistently.
* Kjærlighed – "love" as theological virtue, not emotion.
* Arbeide – "work" in sense of divine service.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Exchange of temporal for eternal must remain vivid metaphor.
* Growth of heavenly treasure tied to salvation of souls.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Joy contrasted with renunciation.
* Severity of command balanced by promise of welcome.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences with balanced clauses.
* Maintain sermonic flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE‑PRESERVING)

If we saw it in this light, how utterly different the question of giving to the mission among the heathen would appear to us! With a joy infinitely greater and purer than that of the miser over his growing treasures, we would then take part in bringing forth our gifts for the work of the salvation of the heathen. With steadily increasing interest we would give heed to every sign of the work’s progress and to the increase in the number of those who are saved.

Life would come into prayer and labor and gifts, if we were permitted to see that in this way our heavenly treasures increase, as the work advances and souls are won through the apostolic work in which we share; and we would soon forget that we had offered and renounced anything, when in truth we had only exchanged earthly possessions for eternal treasures in the Kingdom of God.

Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven. This is Jesus’ own counsel and his own command to those who would belong to the Kingdom of God and become partakers of its glory. Let us follow his word; only in this way can we put his power to the test. Let us take our gifts and abilities, our time and our life, our goods and possessions, and lay it all down before him and say: I am not my own, but I am yours; take me into your service, and use me in your work, and teach me to employ all that I have for the advancement of your Kingdom in the manner that you yourself will.

If we could succeed in being so wholly devoted to Jesus and to have the eternal Kingdom of God before our eyes in all things, then we would be free and happy by reason of love, which is the heart’s one true good portion, which through ages upon ages shall not be taken from us. And what we gave from the impulse of love for the work of the Kingdom of God would be repaid to us many times over in the resurrection of the dead, when the friends whom we won would greet us and welcome us into the eternal dwellings.
