STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Riget" – carries theological weight: the Kingdom of God, not a political realm.
* "Mennestefiskere" – biblical metaphor (fishers of men); must retain imagery.
* "overvættes Kraft" – superhuman / transcendent power; not merely "great strength."
* "Forstand" – rational faculty; often paired with "natural feeling" in Lutheran anthropology.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with causal layering and theological buildup.
* Balanced antitheses ("paa den ene Side … paa den anden Side").
* Sermonic escalation toward exhortation; must not be broken into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of divine agency vs. human weakness.
* Calling and discipleship as divine act.
* Impossibility for humans contrasted with divine omnipotence.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressing conscience.
* Warning against despising Christ’s followers.
* Elevated sermonic cadence; modernization would flatten moral force.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Redskaber" – instruments; Pauline/Lutheran imagery of God using human means.
* "os til Lærdom" – Romans 15:4 echo; KJV: "written for our learning."
* "nedlægger Loven" – establishes the governing principle, not Mosaic Law.
* "tage Korset op" – Synoptic gospel idiom; discipleship involving suffering.
* "for Mennesker er dette umuligt" – Matthew 19:26 echo.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: God’s glory is magnified by using weak instruments.
* Proof: Galilean fishermen as founders of the Kingdom.
* Doctrinal principle: This pattern governs God’s work in all ages.
* Exhortation: True discipleship begins with following Jesus.
* Appeal: Personal testing of the cost of following Christ.
* Conclusion: Human impossibility answered by divine omnipotence.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 4:19 – "I will make you fishers of men."
* Romans 15:4 – "written for our learning."
* Synoptic calls to discipleship (cross-bearing).
* Matthew 19:26 – "With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings and exhortations remain unsoftened.
* The call of Christ is presented as weighty and demanding.
* Divine glory emphasized over human capability.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and impossibility preserved ("is," "must," "cannot").
* No weakening of Christ’s demands or human inability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kingdom (Riget)
* Follow / following (Efterfølgelse)
* Power (Kraft)
* Impossible (umuligt)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fishing imagery retained.
* Cross-bearing kept metaphorical, not explanatory.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Contrast between divine glory and human weakness.
* Severity in demand, consolation in divine power.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where reasoning accumulates.
* Sermonic rhythm maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

For if, on the one hand, it is true that there could scarcely have been found more insignificant people to serve as founders of the Kingdom than Galilean fishermen, then, on the other hand, it is altogether clear that if these Galilean fishermen could become instruments for the great work which may be seen on this day, this is all the more to the glory of God and to the praise of our Lord Jesus Christ, since it is a proof that the surpassing power which was granted to these fishermen is not from human beings, but from God.

And as all the Word of God, so also these verses are written for our learning; for they do not merely recount a bygone event which now has only historical interest, but they lay down the governing principle for the work of the Kingdom of God for all times. For what Jesus willed then, when he called Simon and Andrew, he wills still. And just as it took place then that a fisherman could become a fisher of men, so it takes place still:

“Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men!”

The following of Jesus is the first thing.

If the unbelieving mockers had understood all that lies therein, they would scarcely have despised the men whom Jesus called to help build the Kingdom of God upon the earth.

“Follow me.” Oh, what a call and what a task! Look upon him who went before, behold his way and his walk, behold his struggle and victory, his work and suffering, his humiliation and his glory, and judge for yourself whether it is such a small matter to follow Jesus that the experience and testimony of those who have followed him are of no worth!

Or test for yourself what it is to take up the cross and follow Jesus, and you will surely perceive that the demand is so great, and according to natural feeling and understanding so beyond human measure, that already concerning the fulfillment of this first demand Jesus says: For human beings this is impossible, but for God nothing is impossible.
