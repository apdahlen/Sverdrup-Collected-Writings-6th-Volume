STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "krybe bag" – metaphorical evasion; not physical crawling but moral hiding behind others’ callings.
* "Arvtagere" – heirs/successors with apostolic continuity, not legal inheritance only.
* "Grundvold" – foundation with Pauline–biblical resonance (Eph. 2:20).
* "formaner" – solemn apostolic exhortation, not casual encouragement.
* "Menighedslemmer / Legems Lemmer" – ecclesial body imagery; must preserve Pauline body metaphor.
* "Mennestefiskere" – established biblical term (Matt. 4:19); must not paraphrase.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences joined by "Og" reflecting sermonic cadence.
* Rhetorical questions driving argument; must retain interrogative force.
* Parallel clauses reinforcing inevitability; avoid breaking into short sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Apostolic succession understood corporately (congregation as bearer of calling).
* Universal vocation of the church, not clerical restriction.
* Mission theology grounded in Christ’s continuing call.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, implicating the reader directly.
* Warning against spiritual passivity.
* Solemn insistence on continuity between apostolic age and present.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "krybe bag Apostlerne / Præsterne" – idiom for excusing oneself by appealing to others’ office.
* "bygget paa deres Grundvold" – clear echo of Eph. 2:20; KJV structure suitable.
* "vorder mine Efterfølgere, ligesom jeg er Kristi" – 1 Cor. 11:1; retain imperative gravity.
* "Herren vil endnu have" – expresses divine will persisting in time.
* "Mennestefiskere" – Matt. 4:19; established biblical diction should be retained.

Literal translation risks:

* Rendering idioms too concretely would obscure moral force.
* Softening imperatives would diminish theological urgency.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Rejection of evasion: believers cannot hide behind apostles or clergy.
* Assertion of continuity: the congregation inherits apostolic calling.
* Scriptural proof: Paul’s exhortation applies to all true members.
* Doctrinal claim: Christ still wills the same labor for his body.
* Missional logic: the world and need remain as vast as ever.
* Climactic appeal: Christ’s call sounds ever clearer to all who hear.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Eph. 2:20 – church built on the foundation of the apostles.
* 1 Cor. 11:1 – imitation of Paul as he imitates Christ.
* 1 Cor. 12 / Rom. 12 – body and members imagery.
* Matt. 4:19 – call to be fishers of men.
* Isaianic / gospel imagery of opened doors and prepared ways.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain direct address and moral pressure.
* Preserve warnings against exemption from calling.
* Retain earnest insistence on obedience.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke" – absolute impossibility, not mere difficulty.
* "vil" – divine determination, not preference.
* Imperatives must remain imperatives.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – congregation / church (used consistently).
* Lemmer – members.
* Kristi Legeme – body of Christ.
* Mennestefiskere – fishers of men.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Body imagery retained.
* Sea and fishing metaphor preserved without explanation.
* Doors, gates, and ways kept vivid.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in rebuke balanced with expansive hope.
* Urgency intensifies toward the conclusion.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Repeated "And" clauses preserved for proclamation rhythm.
* Long sentences retained where reasoning accumulates.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

And we cannot hide behind the apostles and say: they must go, but not I; nor behind the pastors and say: they must go, but not I. For who are the heirs of the apostles if not the congregation that is built upon their foundation? And whom does Paul exhort when he says, Be followers of me, even as I am of Christ, if not all true members of the congregation? Truly, the Lord still wills to have the members of his body engaged in the same labor as in the ancient days. And he continues to call his followers, his whole congregation and each of its individual members, to be fishers of men.

And the sea is just as deep and full of fish, and the world just as great and full of people. And though the congregation has grown and the number of Christians increased, yet there are perhaps just as many heathen left to preach to now as in the days of the apostles. For the number of the heathen has also grown.

And the doors are open and the gates burst apart, and the ways are prepared to all lands and all peoples. And as the days pass, the call of Jesus sounds ever clearer and more earnestly to all who hear his word: Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men!
