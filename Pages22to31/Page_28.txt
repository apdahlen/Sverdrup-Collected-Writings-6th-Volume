STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hedningerne" – must be rendered as “the Gentiles,” preserving biblical-missiological force.
* "Adventens Tid" – not merely seasonal but eschatological-missiological Advent.
* "Rigets Evangelium" – Kingdom Gospel; avoid generic “good news.”
* "Enden" – eschatological consummation, not mere termination.
* "Herrens Førelser" – providential governance; avoid modern managerial tone.
* "iodemerist Forventning" – idiomatic critique of idle millenarianism; requires interpretive care.
* "Pund" – biblical unit from the parable (Luke 19); must remain metaphorical.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with rhetorical repetition ("Og hvad saa?").
* Sermonic pacing through anaphora and question-response structure.
* Embedded biblical quotations requiring cadence preservation.

Theological Hazards:

* Advent as Christ’s coming in grace and judgment.
* Mission to the Gentiles as divine initiative, not human progress.
* Judgment, final accounting, and eschatological urgency.
* Grace for sinners contrasted with wrath for the resistant.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone addressing conscience directly.
* Warning must not be softened into reflection.
* Rhetorical urgency (“nu / snart”) must retain sharp contrast.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "han kommer — nedigjennem de veks­lende Tider" – idiom for Christ’s continual advent through history.
* "taler Fred" – biblical echo (Eph. 2); proclamation of reconciliation.
* "Kongens Ærinde har Hast" – proverb-like urgency; mission is pressing.
* "fattig og fuld af Frelse" – Zech. 9:9 Christological image.
* "Kjøb slaar, indtil jeg kommer" – Luke 19:13; stewardship imperative.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Christ’s historical coming to successive peoples.
* Present contrast: unbelief within Christendom vs. Advent among Gentiles.
* Eschatological horizon: Gospel preached → End → Judgment.
* Application to believers: vocation to labor urgently.
* Ethical exhortation: active, sacrificial love vs. idle expectation.
* Final warning and summons grounded in coming judgment.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Eph. 2:17 – preaching peace to the Gentiles.
* Matt. 24:14 – Gospel of the Kingdom preached to all nations.
* 2 Cor. 6:2 – now is the acceptable time, day of salvation.
* Zech. 9:9 – humble king bringing salvation.
* Luke 19:12–27 – parable of the pounds/minas.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain warning, urgency, and moral pressure.
* Preserve direct address (“Venner”).
* Avoid consolatory dilution of judgment language.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve necessity in “are called,” “must,” “shall be asked.”
* Avoid permissive or optional tone.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Kingdom / King consistently.
* Salvation / grace / judgment kept stable.
* Work / labor as vocation, not merit.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Day vs. night; now vs. soon.
* Accounting and interest imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Grace now; judgment soon.
* Consolation for believers; terror for the resistant.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and rhetorical questions.
* Preserve anaphora and proclamation rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Thus see: he comes—down through the changing ages—to one people after another. He speaks peace to the Gentiles and offers them a blessed entrance into his Kingdom.

And precisely now in our own days, when there is so much unbelief and ungodliness, sloth and cold indifference at home within Christendom, there is once again a glorious Advent season among the Gentiles. Christ comes and speaks peace to the Gentiles, and with swift steps the time draws near when the Gospel of the Kingdom has been preached to all peoples.

And what then? Then comes the End—the glorious outcome of the Lord’s dealings with the fallen race, the dreadful, final judgment over all those who have withstood the Kingdom of God unto the very last.

And what does all this mean for us, who in this last time confess faith in the reconciled and risen Christ Jesus, in the King who rules over all things?

Does it not mean this, friends, that we are called to labor while it is day? Does it not mean this, that “the King’s business requires haste”?

Behold, now is an acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. Now the Lord comes, “poor and full of salvation,” with the Kingdom of grace for poor sinners, whom he calls out of darkness into his marvelous light. Soon he comes as Judge, with punishment for the resistant, with glory for his faithful ones.

Between this “now” and this “soon” lies our time for work. It is not an idle, chiliastic expectation, with hands folded in the lap, that is pleasing to the Lord. It is the self-sacrificing, self-denying love that seeks the lost and offers it rescue and salvation through faith in Jesus—this is what is required.

Soon the cry will sound for the last time: The Lord is coming! Then our day of reckoning also comes, when the interest on our pounds will be demanded. Let us therefore, in this Advent season as well, listen to the exhortation he has given us:

Trade until I come!\footnote{A reference to the Parable of the Minas (Luke 19:13). The Dano-Norwegian \textit{Kjøbslaaer} (rendered here as Trade'') emphasizes the servant's responsibility to actively utilize the spiritual gifts (the pounds'') entrusted to them by the Master until His return.}
