STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Forjættelser" – carries covenantal, biblical weight; must be rendered as "promises" or "promises of promise" with scriptural gravity.
* "Hedningefolkene / Hedninger" – theologically charged; must be rendered as "the Gentiles" rather than neutral ethnographic terms.
* "Gudsdyrkelse" – more than "worship"; includes cultic service.
* "egenretfærdige" – doctrinally precise term: "self-righteous," not merely "proud."
* "Offergave / Offere" – sacrificial terminology; must retain cultic resonance.
* "Hærskarernes Gud" – divine title with strong biblical echo: "the Lord of hosts."

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with causal logic and moral pressure.
* Sermonic exposition that must not be fragmented.
* Embedded scriptural citations and explanatory clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of God’s sufficiency (aseity) versus human offering.
* Sin of self-righteous worship.
* Universality of God’s lordship over Jews and Gentiles.
* True versus false sacrifice.

Voice Hazards:

* Strong rebuke of Israel’s presumption.
* Exhortational tone aimed at conscience.
* Irony and moral exposure must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Fra Solens Opgang til dens Nedgang" – biblical merism (cf. Ps. 113:3); denotes universality.
* "Dyrene paa tusinde Bjerge" – echo of Psalm 50:10; signifies God’s self-sufficiency.
* "brændes Røgelse" – cultic idiom indicating acceptable worship.
* The Jews "thinking God owes them thanks" – rhetorical exaggeration exposing pride.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Scriptural thesis (Mal. 1:11): God’s name will be glorified among the Gentiles.
* Exposition: Prophetic promises of Gentile conversion.
* Rebuke: Israel’s false estimation of its own worship.
* Theological correction: God’s independence from human offerings.
* Conclusion: God will receive true worship from all nations.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Malachi 1:11 (explicit quotation).
* Psalm 50:10 ("cattle on a thousand hills").
* Psalmic universality motifs (Ps. 113:3).
* Pauline echo anticipations (Rom. 3:29 – God of Jews and Gentiles).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Rebuke remains sharp and accusatory.
* No mitigation of Israel’s guilt.
* God’s majesty and self-sufficiency remain absolute.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" rendered consistently as "shall."
* Necessity and certainty are not weakened.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Offere / Offergave → "sacrifice / offering"
* Hedninger → "Gentiles"
* Gud → "God" / "the Lord"
* Navn → "name" (theological sense)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Sacrificial imagery retained.
* Spatial universality preserved.
* Economic metaphor (God’s lack of need) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From promise → rebuke → correction → universal hope.
* No flattening of contrasts.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where reasoning accumulates.
* Sermonic rhythm preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\subsection{From the rising of the sun even to its going down}

\begin{quote}
For from the rising of the sun and unto its going down my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered and a sacrifice brought to my name, a pure offering; for great shall my name be among the nations, says the Lord of hosts. Malachi 1:11.
\end{quote}

The writings of the prophets in the Old Testament contain many promises concerning the conversion and salvation of the Gentiles in the messianic age. Among these is also the above promise in the prophet Malachi. The Lord will show the Jews that their conceited and self-righteous thoughts concerning their own great worth, and the great worth of their worship in the sight of the Lord, were altogether vain and erroneous. Indeed, they were rather blasphemous toward God than pleasing to him. For the Jews imagined that, in truth, it was not they who ought to thank God, but that God in fact owed them thanks for their worship and their sacrifices; since there was, after all, no other people who worshiped and served the Lord except themselves alone. Therefore the Lord, they supposed, must be content, even if their sacrifices were not great and not so carefully in accordance with the Law; for a poor sacrifice was surely better than none at all.

Such thoughts were, as we have said, not merely conceited, arrogant, and self-righteous, but even blasphemous toward God. For the true God, the Creator of heaven and earth, the Lord to whom belong the cattle on a thousand hills, is surely not in need of Israel’s wretched sacrifices, as though he should desire them out of his own poverty and lack.

In order that Israel may now grasp and acknowledge its sin in this matter, and see how it in reality exalts itself and diminishes the Lord, the Lord therefore announces through the prophet Malachi the entrance of the Gentiles into the kingdom of God, and bears witness to how they shall bring to him true and right sacrifices.

Israel ought in truth to be ashamed of its delusions that the Lord cannot be without it and its sacrifices; for the Lord lacks no sacrifices. He is the God of all the earth; he is not the God of Jews only, but also of Gentiles; and he shall receive sacrifice and worship and honor and praise from the whole earth and from all peoples.
