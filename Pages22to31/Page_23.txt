STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Levning" – biblical-theological term meaning "remnant," not mere remainder.
* "Dugg" – metaphor with scriptural resonance (Micah 5), not simple moisture.
* "Naadens Udvælgelse" – Pauline doctrinal phrase (Romans 11), must retain election-by-grace sense.
* "Vederkvikelse" – spiritual refreshment, not mere emotional relief.
* "Nederbølgelsens Tider" – archaic pietistic phrase for times of divine visitation/refreshing.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with layered causal logic.
* Embedded biblical quotations and paraphrases.
* Sermonic rhythm with cumulative clauses.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of election, grace alone, Pentecost, work of the Holy Spirit.
* Ecclesiology: disciples becoming the Church.
* Christological sequence: incarnation, death, resurrection, ascension, sending of the Spirit.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest Lutheran exhortational tone.
* Address to conscience and faith community.
* Risk of flattening into neutral historical prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Jakobs Levning" – from Micah 5:7; denotes the faithful remnant preserved by God.
* "Som en Dugg fra Herren" – divine initiative, blessing independent of human agency.
* "Ikke bier paa nogen" – echoes Micah 5:7; God’s action not contingent on human waiting.
* "Natten var fremgangen, og Dagen var kommen nær" – Romans 13:12 echo; eschatological turning point.
* KJV parallels: "remnant," "dew from the LORD," "times of refreshing."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: Micah’s prophecy fulfilled at Pentecost.
* Identification of the disciples as the true remnant of Jacob.
* Pauline confirmation from Romans 11:5.
* Doctrinal clarification: the remnant exists solely by grace.
* Causal argument: because their only hope was grace, the Spirit came upon them.
* Climactic description of Pentecost as divine visitation.
* Missional conclusion: the dew becomes dew among the nations.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Micah 5:7 – dew imagery and remnant of Jacob.
* Acts 2 – Pentecost narrative.
* Romans 11:5 – remnant according to grace.
* Romans 13:12 – night/day imagery.
* Acts 3:19 – times of refreshing.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain solemn wonder and doctrinal seriousness.
* Preserve awe at divine initiative.
* Avoid sentimentalization of Pentecost.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and divine initiative expressed without weakening.
* Preserve causal connectors ("therefore," "because").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Levning = remnant
* Naade = grace
* Aand = Spirit
* Velsignelse = blessing

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Dew imagery retained throughout.
* Rain and refreshment not reduced to abstraction.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Movement from suffering remnant to rejoicing congregation.
* Contrast between human helplessness and divine abundance.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences where theological reasoning accumulates.
* Preserve sermonic flow and breathing space.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Micah’s prophecy concerning the remnant of Jacob, that it should be “in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD,” was fulfilled on that Pentecost day when the Spirit came upon Jesus’ disciples and made them into a congregation. Those praying disciples in the upper room were precisely “the remnant of Jacob.” Or upon whom could this name have fitted better than upon that small, trembling flock who, under distress and persecution, held fast to Israel’s hope, the promised and risen Messiah?

It is of these, and of those who were united with them in the same faith, that Paul writes in Romans chapter 11, verse 5: “So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.”

Yes, precisely “chosen by grace”; for both the fact that there is a remnant at all is sheer grace, and every single one of these men and women, who together are called “the remnant of Jacob,” is among those who have been preserved by grace alone.

And precisely because they had no other hope and no other deliverance than grace alone, therefore there came upon them, “like dew from the LORD,” God’s own Spirit, who “does not wait for anyone and does not tarry for the children of men.” In the Lord’s own time, when he saw that “the night was far gone and the day was near,” then the dew fell from heaven and granted the longing hearts blessed refreshment. Then they rejoiced in the great works of God and praised him with a loud voice, because he had fulfilled his wondrous counsel of salvation, and had caused his own Son both to be born and to die and to rise from the dead and to ascend into heaven and to sit at the Father’s right hand, from where he had now sent them the Holy Spirit.

Truly, it was like dew from the LORD and like showers upon the grass. It is credible that there has never at any time been greater promise resting upon unlearned human hearts than precisely on that day; these truly came to experience what the times of refreshing from the LORD are for a human soul.

But precisely because dew from the LORD came upon these disciples and made them into a congregation, therefore they also became, in the midst of many peoples, like dew from the LORD.

They did not keep the blessing to themselves. They began to speak in other tongues, so that both the Jews who dwelt in Jerusalem and the devout men from every nation under heaven were compelled to marvel that they heard them speak, each in his own tongue, of the great works of God.
