STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Velsignelse" carries covenantal and vocational weight (being made a blessing), not merely receiving blessing.
* "lade os bruge" implies voluntary yielding to divine use, not instrumentalization.
* "Tjeneste" denotes total service under lordship, not occasional volunteering.
* "Liv" functions both biologically and theologically (Christ as life; life given away).
* "Missionen" is not a program but the Church’s God-given task.
* "Dugdraabens Liv" evokes Hosea/Micah imagery; not simply freshness, but quiet, God-given efficacy.
* "Levning" (remnant) is a loaded biblical-theological term.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with causal logic must remain intact.
* Rhetorical questions demand preservation of moral pressure.
* Parallel clauses (as he gave / as he received) must remain symmetrical.

Theological Hazards:

* Total consecration vs. partial service must not be softened.
* Mission as divine necessity, not optional activity.
* Life-giving paradox (giving life to receive life) must remain doctrinally sharp.
* Remnant theology and divine agency (not waiting on human initiative).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Avoid motivational or inspirational smoothing.
* Preserve solemn urgency and ecclesial accountability.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Intet for os selv, alt for ham" – absolute consecration formula; must remain stark.
* "som han gav, saa faar vi ogsaa, som han fik" – Christological imitation with eschatological logic.
* "arbeide saa leilighedsvis lidt" – critique of sporadic engagement.
* "midt iblandt mange Folk" – biblical phraseology echoing Micah 5:7.
* Direct quotation aligns closely with Micah 5:7 (KJV resonance helpful but modern pronouns required).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening question: Does the Lord intend the same for us?
* Affirmation: Yes—conditional upon full surrender.
* Christological grounding: He is our life; therefore life must be given.
* Practical implication: Mission cannot be occasional.
* Ecclesial thesis: Mission is the Church’s defining goal.
* Self-examination through rhetorical questioning.
* Confession of failure.
* Call to repentance grounded in divine promise.
* Scriptural conclusion (Micah 5:7).

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Micah 5:7 – Jacob’s remnant as dew from the Lord.
* John 14:6 / Colossians 3:4 – Christ as our life.
* Implicit echo of the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19–20).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain uncompromising call to total availability.
* Retain rebuke implicit in rhetorical questions.
* Preserve urgency without exaggeration.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vil" (will) retains divine intentionality.
* "gaar det ikke an" must remain categorical impossibility.
* "maa" in confession implies moral necessity.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Life = life (theological, Christ-centered).
* Service = service.
* Mission = mission (capitalized where ecclesial).
* Blessing = blessing (active, vocational sense).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Dew and rain imagery must remain intact.
* Avoid explanatory paraphrase.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Hopeful promise → sharp critique → sober confession → renewed promise.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and balanced clauses.
* Maintain sermonic flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Will the Lord truly will the same for us? Yes, indeed, he wills to make us as a blessing, if we are willing to let ourselves be used wholly and entirely, and exclusively, in his service. Nothing for ourselves, everything for him. He himself is our life; therefore he wills that we should live in such a way that we do not keep life for ourselves, but give, as he gave—then we also receive, as he received.

Therefore it is not possible for a Christian to work only occasionally, a little, for the Mission among the many peoples. This is our true task in life; it is our abiding calling. It is the goal of the congregation that the gospel should be preached to all peoples, to the end of the world.

Do we do this? Do all congregations do this? Yes, each may answer for himself. Most of us must surely confess that we do not live the life of the dewdrop, “in the midst of many peoples.”

Therefore it is time for us to awaken and to take to heart the Lord’s promise, which he wills to be fulfilled upon us and through us: “And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the Lord, like showers upon the grass, that do not wait for anyone and do not linger for the children of men.”
