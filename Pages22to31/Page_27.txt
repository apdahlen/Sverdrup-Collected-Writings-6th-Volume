STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Røst" — carries biblical resonance (voice of God/Christ), not merely "voice".
* "Frelse" — must be consistently rendered as "salvation," not rescue or deliverance.
* "Hedninger" — theological term meaning Gentiles, not pagans in a pejorative sense.
* "bi" / "bier" — older verb meaning to wait patiently.
* "Sendrægtighed" — sluggishness, spiritual sloth; not simple delay.
* "Utroskab" — faithlessness, covenantal unfaithfulness, not infidelity.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with commas and semicolons expressing sermonic flow.
* Embedded biblical speech (“Your sins are forgiven… Fear not…”).
* Logical progression carried by connective phrases rather than paragraph breaks.

Theological Hazards:

* Messianic confession and exclusivity (“one, true, rightful Messiah”).
* Salvation history: Israel, Gentiles, mission to the ends of the earth.
* Divine patience vs. human impatience in missions.
* Doctrine of grace offered in the "proper time".

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational address to the conscience (“you impatient heart!”).
* Warning against murmuring against the Lord.
* Pastoral severity mixed with consolation.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "tale Fred til de urolige Hjerter" — biblical idiom for divine consolation (cf. John 14).
* "Storm og Bølger" — echo of Christ calming the sea (Synoptic Gospels).
* "Dine Synder er dig forladte" — direct Gospel absolution formula (Mark 2; Luke 7).
* "Hedningernes Lys" — Isaiah 49; Luke 2.
* "stikke Sværdet i Balgen" — Peter in Gethsemane (John 18).
* "Korsets Evangelium" — Pauline theology (1 Cor. 1).
* "Høst" — mission metaphor (Matt. 9).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Confession of Christ’s identity and saving authority.
* Expansion of Messiah’s mission from Israel to the nations.
* Rejection of worldly power as means of conquest.
* Description of the kingdom’s quiet yet unstoppable growth.
* Addressing impatience and doubt regarding mission progress.
* Pastoral correction and call to trust divine timing.
* Eschatological assurance of God’s wise governance.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Calming the storm — Matt. 8; Mark 4.
* Absolution sayings — Luke 7; Mark 2.
* Light to the Gentiles — Isaiah 49; Luke 2.
* Peace to near and far — Ephesians 2.
* Harvest and workers — Matthew 9.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain solemn exhortation without sentimentality.
* Retain rebuke of murmuring and impatience.
* Preserve confidence in divine sovereignty.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skulde" / "maatte" rendered with full necessity ("must," "was to").
* Imperatives retained as imperatives.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Frelse — salvation
* Rige — kingdom
* Naade — grace
* Evangelium — gospel

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Storm, harvest, light, kingdom growth preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward impatience.
* Consolation in divine faithfulness.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where argument accumulates.
* Commas and semicolons retained for sermonic rhythm.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

They had known the quiet, mighty Voice that spoke peace to troubled hearts, and that brought storm and waves to be still. They had heard him who could say: Your sins are forgiven you! Fear not! Your faith has saved you! They knew that he was the one, true, rightful Messiah, and that no other was to be awaited.

But he who came to Zion and Jerusalem, poor and yet so full of salvation, so rich in heavenly love, he was not only to be a glory for Israel, he was also to be a light to the Gentiles, and his salvation was to reach to the ends of the earth.

Yet not by outward power was he to bring the nations under himself. He had no need of Ephraim’s chariots or Jerusalem’s horses in order to conquer the world. Rather, he first had to conquer the hearts of his own people before he could begin the conquest. Peter had to learn to put the sword into its sheath, and Paul had to learn to use the gospel of the cross as his weapon, before they could become servants of Christ to spread the kingdom.

It was by proclaiming peace to those who were near and to those who were far away that Jesus spread his kingdom among Jews and Gentiles. And while the kingdoms of the world rise and fall, the kingdom of Jesus Christ stands, and it grows and spreads under the enemy’s snorting wrath, and people after people pay homage to the King of peace.

He who came, still comes. For even yet his course of victory is not completed; even yet the gospel has not been proclaimed over all the earth. At times it seems to us as though it goes so slowly. We soon become discouraged, yes, even doubtful. We ask why he delays in coming, why the work of missions does not proceed much more swiftly, why the Lord does not drive more laborers out into his harvest, why he does not make his children more zealous for the cause of the kingdom.

But be still, you impatient heart! It is not in this way that you are to ask and complain. Indeed, you may complain over your faithlessness and sluggishness; but do not murmur against the Lord! Be assured that he does all things well, and he does not come too late to save.

No, wait only patiently, as you labor, until the day when a clear, radiant light dawns over all the Lord’s leadings. When you then are in the kingdom of light and see with undimmed eye the Lord’s course through time, then you shall surely also see this: that every people and every person has had the gospel sent to them at the proper time, and that none are unsaved among those who were willing to receive grace unto salvation.
