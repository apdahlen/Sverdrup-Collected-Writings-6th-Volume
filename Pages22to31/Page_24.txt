STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* vederkvægede / Vederkvægelse – older devotional term meaning spiritual refreshment or consolation, not mere pleasure.
* Menigheden – theological sense of the Church/congregation as God’s gathered people, not simply an institution.
* Levning – biblical remnant (cf. Micah), not leftovers.
* Dugg / Regnskur – biblically charged imagery of divine grace and life-giving presence.
* Pintse – Pentecost as lived spiritual event, not only historical feast.
* fremstille os frivillig – to present oneself willingly, cultic/ethical overtones.
* hellige Krig – spiritual warfare, not political or violent conflict.
* Vældes Dag – day of God’s power/manifest rule (cf. Ps. 110).
* Drift – inward impulse or driving of the Holy Spirit.
* Tungemaal – languages, echoing Pentecost narrative.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long paratactic sentences with theological accumulation.
* Frequent rhetorical questions.
* Parallel constructions that build exhortational pressure.
* Sermonic cadence that should not be broken into short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Grace (Naade) as sole ground of salvation.
* Role of the Holy Spirit in illumination and mission.
* Church as instrument, not source, of blessing.
* Personal appropriation of Christ’s death and resurrection.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortation directed to the conscience.
* Warning against passivity and conditional obedience.
* Strong emphasis on divine initiative and human response.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Jakobs Levning” – direct echo of Micah 5:7; remnant preserved by God for blessing among nations.
* “Dugg fra Herren” – grace descending freely, silently, irresistibly.
* “ikke bie paa nogen” – not to wait dependently on human initiative.
* Pentecost imagery – Acts 2, hearts burning, languages, proclamation.
* Dew and rain imagery – Isa. 55; Deut. 32; Mic. 5:7.

Literal translation without biblical resonance would flatten the meaning; King James–shaped diction offers natural equivalents (dew, rain, remnant, burning hearts).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening assertion: Those refreshed by God become refreshment for others.
* Continuity claim: The Church’s situation, gift, and task remain unchanged.
* Scriptural grounding: Remnant imagery (dew and rain among many peoples).
* Personal interrogation: Have we ourselves received this gift?
* Conditional exhortation: If so, voluntary self-offering must follow.
* Rebuke of passivity: Waiting for conditions or personalities.
* Positive definition: True willingness arises from grace and Spirit.
* Mission imperative: Church lives among peoples who do not know the Lord.
* Concluding metaphor: Dew and rain—self-effacing, fruitful, transient servants of life.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Micah 5:7 – remnant as dew among nations.
* Acts 2 – Pentecost, tongues, proclamation, burning hearts.
* Luke 24:32 – hearts burning within us.
* Psalm 110:3 – willing people in the day of God’s power.
* Isaiah 55:10–11 – rain accomplishing God’s purpose.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

The translation must retain:

* Direct address and searching questions.
* Clear rebuke of conditional obedience.
* Urgent missionary consciousness.
* Solemn joy rooted in grace, not enthusiasm.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* vil – must be rendered as strong divine will (“the Lord wills”).
* skal – obligation, not suggestion.
* kan ikke / bier – impossibility and culpable delay.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Naade – grace
* Menighed – Church
* Frelse – salvation
* Aand – Spirit
* Dugg / Regn – dew / rain (unchanged throughout)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Dew and rain retained without explanation.
* Disappearance of droplets kept as image of self-giving service.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Joy of salvation contrasted with rebuke of passivity.
* Quiet consolation alongside sober exhortation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where theological reasoning accumulates.
* Semicolon logic maintained.
* Rhythm suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Thus those who themselves had been refreshed became a refreshment and a heavenly blessing to others. And thus the Church at once began to fulfill its task and to do its work upon the earth, to proclaim the Gospel of God in the midst of many peoples.

Even now the situation is the same, God’s gift is the same, and the Church’s task is the same. Even now the Lord wills that the remnant of Jacob should be in the midst of many peoples like a dew from the Lord and like showers upon the herbs. Even now he wills that it should not wait for anyone and not depend upon the children of men.

Have we received God’s gift, the heavenly dew? Have we experienced some Pentecost over our life, when our hearts burned within us with joy over the Lord’s great works? When the Spirit of God illumined Christ for the heart, so that this word about Jesus’ death and resurrection became something altogether new, because it became something for us, our personal salvation?

If this is so, then the Lord wills that we should present ourselves willingly for his service and for his holy warfare on the day of his power.

There are so many who wait for people, for this or that occasion, for this or that journey, for a powerful summons, for an urgent plea and exhortation, before they can bring themselves to take part. If there should arise some special prospect, or if there should come a man who can deliver a truly gripping address, then they will take part in the work for the kingdom of God. But this is not the true voluntary spirit. The Lord wills that his Church should be ready and willing because of the driving of the Holy Spirit, by virtue of the impulse that lies in this, that we are saved by grace, and that there are so many who know nothing of this salvation.

For even now God’s Church lives upon the earth in the midst of many peoples who do not know the Lord and his great works. And as long as this situation endures, the Lord wills that his Church should speak to the peoples in their own languages about the salvation that has come to it.

Consider what is meant by dew and rain. These are the names that the Lord gives to the Church in our text. Dew and rain do not exist for their own sake alone. They fall from heaven upon the dry earth, upon the fainting herbs, upon the withering grass. Where do they go? Before our eyes they vanish and pass away, the thousands and millions of drops. They sparkle for a moment in the sun and bear its image; then they disappear, and their place knows them no more. Yet their work is done, and life and flourishing are given to the earth and to its herbs.
