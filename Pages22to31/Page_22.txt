STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Dugg" (dew): biblical-theological image of gentle, God-given life and blessing; must not be weakened to mere moisture.
* "Levning" (remnant): covenantal term with prophetic weight; not simply "remainder".
* "Menigheden": ecclesial body (the Church/congregation), not generic "community".
* "Forjættelse": strong promissory term; stronger than "promise" in casual sense.
* "Spaadom": prophecy in the biblical sense, not speculative prediction.
* "Vankundige": spiritually unlearned/ignorant, not merely uninformed.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with coordinated clauses and theological buildup.
* Sermonic pacing with explanatory pivots and rhetorical questions.
* Embedded quotation and commentary that must remain integrated.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of the Church as God’s instrument.
* Divine initiative vs. human waiting (dew that does not wait for man).
* Fulfillment already and still ongoing until the Day of Christ.
* Regeneration and the mystery of the Gospel (Nicodemus reference).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest pastoral exhortation.
* Gentle but serious appeal to conscience.
* Risk of modernizing into reflective prose rather than proclamation.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Som en Dugg fra Herren": idiom from prophetic poetry; denotes unmerited, sovereign blessing from God.
* "der ikke bier paa nogen": biblical idiom meaning not dependent on human action or permission.
* Nicodemus reference (John 3): idiomatically evokes rebirth and divine mystery.
* "Jesu Kristi Dag": Pauline eschatological phrase (Phil. 1:6).
* KJV resonance: "dew from the LORD," "the day of Jesus Christ."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening with Scriptural text and metaphor.
* Assertion: the verse is a prophecy concerning the Church and its blessed work.
* Negation: not an unreal dream or fanatic vision.
* Affirmation: a divine promise already fulfilled and continually fulfilled.
* Application: God desires to fulfill it also in and through us.
* Conditional appeal: depends on willingness to receive God’s gift.
* Rhetorical question: How can this be?
* Biblical parallel: Nicodemus’s question.
* Explanation: Christ rebukes yet explains the Gospel’s mystery.
* Pastoral conclusion: God patiently teaches the ignorant.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Micah 5:7 (Hebrew/Christian numbering varies): remnant as dew.
* John 3: Nicodemus and new birth.
* Philippians 1:6: "the day of Jesus Christ."
* General prophetic motif: remnant theology.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness that this is divine truth, not idealism.
* Retain gentle exhortation without sentimentality.
* Preserve seriousness of divine promise and human responsibility.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vil gjerne": expresses God’s willing intention, not mere possibility.
* "bare Spørgsmaal om": strong conditional emphasis.
* Maintain necessity and implication for the reader.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Dugg = dew
* Forjættelse = promise (consistently theological)
* Menigheden = the Church / the congregation (choose one and keep it)
* Herren = the Lord

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve dew and rain imagery.
* Avoid explanatory paraphrase.
* Keep natural imagery as bearer of doctrine.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Prophetic assertion → pastoral application → gentle consolation.
* Do not flatten contrasts between rebuke and grace.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences where argument unfolds.
* Preserve rhetorical pauses and questions.
* Keep sermon-like flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\subsection{As Dew from the Lord}

\begin{quote}
And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples
like dew from the Lord,
like showers upon the grass,
which do not wait for anyone
and do not tarry for the children of men. Micah 5:6
\end{quote}

%FIXME: "fair" seems off.
This verse in the prophet Micah is a prophecy concerning the Church and its blessed work.
And it is not a mere dream of an enthusiastic visionary, a dream never become more than a shadow that vanishes. It is one of the divine promises that both has been fulfilled and that is continually being fulfilled until the day of Jesus Christ.

God willingly desires to fulfill this promise also in us and through us.

It is only a question of whether we are willing to receive the divine gift that is here promised also to us.

How can this come to pass? — Yes, thus asked Nicodemus that night when he was granted to speak with Jesus. And Jesus gave him a sharp answer, because Nicodemus ought to have known it; yet at the same time he also explained to Nicodemus the mystery of the Gospel of which there was question.

So might someone also answer us, when we ask: How can this come to pass? — that we ought to know better than to ask about that which all Christians ought to be acquainted with. But the Lord is good and gracious; he does not grow weary of explaining to us ignorant human beings his way and his will with us.
