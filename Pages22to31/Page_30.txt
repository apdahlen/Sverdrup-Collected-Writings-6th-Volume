STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Forjættelse – covenantal promise with prophetic and salvific weight, not merely a prediction.
* beskjæmmende / opløftende / trøstefulde – morally and spiritually charged adjectives, not emotional exaggerations.
* Hedningerne / Hedningefolkene – Gentiles in the biblical-theological sense, not pagans in a pejorative modern sense.
* Røgelse / Offergaver – cultic-sacrificial language with typological significance.
* Opfyldelsen – fulfillment in the strong salvation-historical sense.
* Anordninger – ordinances, not general customs.
* Gudsdyrkelse – worship, cultus.
* Aabenbaret i Kjød – Incarnation formula (1 Tim 3:16 resonance).
* Del og vort Liv – participatory soteriology; “portion” and “life,” not metaphorical comfort.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with cumulative theological force.
* Enumerated structures ("To Ting … 1) … 2)") that must remain intact.
* Rhetorical questions driving polemic against idolatry.
* Contrastive pivots ("Men Opfyldelsen viser os jo …").

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of revelation, Incarnation, atonement, resurrection.
* Trinity articulated devotionally rather than schematically.
* Mission theology rooted in prophecy and fulfillment.
* Typology of sacrifice fulfilled in Christ, not perpetuated Mosaic cult.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, didactic, sermonic Lutheran tone.
* Polemical contrast between true God and idols.
* Pastoral confidence in ongoing fulfillment "from day to day."

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Fra Solens Opgang til dens Nedgang" – biblical idiom (Ps 113:3; Mal 1:11) meaning universality.
* "Guds Navns Storhed" – not fame, but revealed glory and saving knowledge.
* "stumme Afguder" – biblical polemic (Ps 115), emphasizing impotence and lack of revelation.
* "Gud er vor Fader, Sønnen vor Frelser, den Helligaand vor Del og vort Liv" – confessional, doxological Trinitarian summary.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Statement of the promise and its double content.
* Question of means: How will this occur?
* Rejection of a Jewish-ritualistic misreading.
* Positive exposition: fulfillment through Christ and the Gospel.
* Polemical comparison with pagan religions.
* Concluding affirmation of ongoing fulfillment.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Malachi 1:11 – Gentile worship and pure offering.
* 1 Timothy 3:16 – God manifested in the flesh.
* Galatians 4:4 – born of a woman.
* Psalm 115 / Isaiah polemics – mute idols.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain firmness in rejecting false interpretations.
* Preserve rhetorical force of questions.
* Retain confidence in the Gospel’s superiority.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal vorde stort" – must/shall become great.
* "skal gaa til" – how it is to take place.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forjættelse – Promise
* Hedninger – Gentiles
* Opfyldelse – Fulfillment
* Evangelium – Gospel

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Do not dissolve sacrificial imagery.
* Preserve contrast between living revelation and mute idols.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Shame for Jews vs. consolation for Gentiles.
* Polemic vs. doxology.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences where argument accumulates.
* Preserve enumerations and rhythmic contrasts.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

This is the Promise—the promise that is a cause of shame to the Jews, but to the Gentiles a promise that uplifts and consoles. Two things are chiefly contained in this promise:

1. that the Lord’s name shall become great, that is, known and spread abroad, honored and exalted from the rising of the sun to its setting among the Gentile nations; and

2. that, as a consequence of this greatness of God’s name, the Gentile nations shall bring to the Lord pleasing incense and pure offerings.

How is this to take place? Of this the Lord says nothing expressly here in this passage. But from the New Testament and from the history of the Gentile mission we know how the Lord intended to fulfill, and has fulfilled, this promise.

It sounds, to be sure, as though the Lord here proclaims that the ordinances and sacrifices of the old covenant were to be spread among all peoples, so that the Gentiles would become Jews in religion and worship, with the sole difference that they would be more faithful and more conscientious than the ancient Israelites were in Malachi’s time.

But the fulfillment shows us plainly that this is not how it was to come about, and that this is not how the fulfillment has come, insofar as it has come down to our own days on its way forward among lands and peoples.

God’s name has become great on earth among human beings through the salvation that is in Jesus Christ, and through the glorious Gospel concerning him and his saving work. That God has been manifest in the flesh; that God has sent forth his Son, born of a woman; and that he has suffered, died, and risen again for our salvation—this is the great wonder that has been preached among the nations and believed in the world, and that has made the Lord’s name great and exceedingly precious everywhere it has been heard. That God is our Father, the Son our Savior, the Holy Spirit our portion and our life—this is what makes God’s name great above all the Gentiles’ mute idols. For where is their revelation? Where is their love? Where is the salvation they have prepared?

When we compare the gods of the Gentiles and their cruel demands upon human beings with the true God and his blessed Gospel, the difference is surely felt, and then it is understood how great and precious, how joyful and praiseworthy the Gospel is. In this way the prophecy is meant, and in this way it has been fulfilled to this very day. Thus the Lord’s name has become great among the Gentiles, and thus it continues to become great from day to day.
