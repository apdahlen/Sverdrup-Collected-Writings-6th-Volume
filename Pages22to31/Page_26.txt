\subsection{Christ’s Coming}

\begin{quote}
Rejoice greatly, Daughter of Zion! Cry aloud, Daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King comes to you; righteous is he and full of salvation, lowly and riding upon a donkey, upon a colt, the foal of a donkey. And I will cut off the chariots from Ephraim and the horses from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off; and he shall speak peace to the nations, and his dominion shall be from sea to sea and from the River to the ends of the earth. Zech. 9:9–10.
\end{quote}

The prophet sees in the Spirit Christ coming, and he portrays him as he sees him. He so earnestly desires that Zion, his royal city, and Israel, his people, should see him and know him and pay him homage. He wishes that no one should misunderstand the Messiah or take offense at him because he appears lowly and weak. Therefore he lays weight upon this: that the Messiah’s lowliness is in no way a sign of impotence or defeat; for victory and power shall nevertheless be his, even though he wins his victories in a manner different from the lords and kings of the world.

As Zechariah prophesied, so it also came to pass. Christ came, and he came in the greatest lowliness. He who at any moment could command legions of angels, he walked so patiently about among the people and allowed enemies to mock him, allowed unrighteous judges to condemn him, allowed scourgers to strike and soldiers to deride him; yes, he was as a worm and not a man, the reproach of men and the despised of the people. He was like a man in whose mouth there is no protest; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that is silent before those who shear it.

And yet even in his days of lowliness, in his deepest humiliation, there was nevertheless a power and fullness beneath the suffering, as though hidden behind the patience, which was felt in a strange way by all who had dealings with him.

Look at those who went out with Judas to seize him! How they immediately fell to the ground when he stepped toward them with his gentle word: It is I, Jesus of Nazareth; if you seek me, then let these go their way! And those priests who pronounced an unrighteous judgment upon him—how did their hearts not tremble! And Pilate, poor Pilate, how he writhed in distress over “this righteous man,” and how reluctantly he pronounced that Jesus should be crucified!

And they had good reason to grow pale and to tremble. For this righteous one whom they put to death proved himself by the resurrection from the dead to be the Lord of glory and the Prince of life. No wonder that secret fear already seized them while they sat in judgment over him who shall judge the living and the dead.

But at the same time that Jesus’ lowliness was an offense to many, because they expected a great outward glory in the Messiah, there were nevertheless also those who could confess: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. They had found the Messiah in him, and they rejoiced over it with that unquenchable joy which accompanies the soul’s experience of the new, spiritual life.
