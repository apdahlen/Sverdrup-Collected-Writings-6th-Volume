DISCLAIMER

This repository contains experimental tools, workflows, and example outputs
for the analysis, translation, and interpretation of historical and theological
texts using structured methods and AI-assisted processes.

This project is intended for educational, research, and exploratory purposes
only. It is not a doctrinal authority, not a substitute for trained theological,
historical, or linguistic judgment, and not a replacement for professional
translation, pastoral discernment, or academic peer review.

The English translations in this volume were generated primarily through artificial
intelligence–based language tools operating under detailed scholarly instructions.
These translations were subsequently reviewed, evaluated, and corrected through an
independent secondary AI process for semantic, theological, and stylistic fidelity
to the original Norwegian sources. Editorial responsibility in the present edition
is limited to methodological design, critical oversight, and presentation; the
original source texts remain authoritative.

The editor does not claim ecclesiastical authority or interpretive finality.
Users are responsible for how they apply, adapt, or rely on the material in
this repository.

If you are using these materials in academic, ecclesial, pastoral, or teaching
contexts, you are strongly encouraged to consult qualified professionals and to
treat these tools as aids to reflection and analysis rather than as authoritative
sources.

Use at your own discretion and responsibility.
