DISCLAIMER

This repository contains experimental tools, workflows, and example outputs
for the analysis, translation, and interpretation of historical and theological
texts using structured methods and AI-assisted processes.

This project is intended for educational, research, and exploratory purposes
only. It is not a doctrinal authority, not a substitute for trained theological,
historical, or linguistic judgment, and not a replacement for professional
translation, pastoral discernment, or academic peer review.

The methods presented here are designed to help identify potential areas of
semantic, theological, rhetorical, and interpretive drift in texts and
translations. They do not determine truth, correctness, orthodoxy, or meaning.
All outputs require careful human review, contextual understanding, and
responsible use.

The author does not claim ecclesiastical authority or interpretive finality.
Users are responsible for how they apply, adapt, or rely on the material in
this repository.

If you are using these materials in academic, ecclesial, pastoral, or teaching
contexts, you are strongly encouraged to consult qualified professionals and to
treat these tools as aids to reflection and analysis rather than as authoritative
sources.

Use at your own discretion and responsibility.
