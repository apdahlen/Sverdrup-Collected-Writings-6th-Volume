STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Aand" – must be rendered as "Spirit" with full Johannine–pneumatological force, not reduced to emotion or disposition.
* "overbevise" – carries juridical and convicting force (cf. John 16), stronger than mere persuasion.
* "Synd, Retfærdighed, Dom" – technical Johannine triad; must remain intact and capitalized as doctrinal categories.
* "dragne" – echoes John 6; must preserve divine initiative and effectual calling.
* "grebne" – implies being seized or apprehended, not merely inspired.
* "sønderknuste" – biblical term (Ps. 51); must retain imagery of inner breaking, not emotional sadness.
* "forgaa" – eschatological ruin, not simply suffering.
* "Myndighed" – authority derived from Christ, not institutional power.
* "Hedningeverden" – theological term for the Gentile world, not merely non-Europeans.
* "Urenhed" – moral, spiritual, and ritual impurity; must not be hygienized.
* "meddeler" – communicates or imparts; implies participation, not example alone.
* "Længsel" – deep yearning or consuming desire, not mild concern.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with theological logic must not be broken into short modern sentences.
* Parallel conditional clauses (“Blir vi ikke…”) require rhythmic preservation.
* Sermonic rhetorical questions must retain gravity and pressure.
* Cause–effect reasoning must remain explicit.

Theological Hazards:

* Conviction of sin as divine act, not psychological insight.
* Human will’s submission to Christ’s will must retain monergistic emphasis.
* Salvation language (lost, saved, perishing) must retain eternal stakes.
* Church as the Body of Christ must remain organic and instrumental, not metaphorical only.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone must not be softened into reflective prose.
* Moral pressure on the reader must remain intact.
* Missionary urgency must not become abstract theology.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "overbevise os om Synd og om Retfærdighed og om Dom" – direct echo of John 16:8; KJV cadence provides natural English structure.
* "dragne af Faderen" – John 6:44; must preserve divine initiative.
* "grebne af Kristus" – Pauline resonance (Phil. 3:12); conveys being seized.
* "Herre, frels os, vi forgaa" – cry of the disciples (Matt. 8:25); must retain immediacy and desperation.
* Gold/Diamond metaphor – common pietistic imagery; must remain concrete and vivid.
* "vandre det Kald værdig" – Eph. 4:1; established ecclesial idiom.

Literal translation risks:

* Rendering "Længsel" as mere “interest” would erase sacrificial force.
* Explaining metaphors instead of preserving them would flatten rhetoric.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Human will cannot submit to Christ apart from divine conviction and breaking.
* Means: This breaking occurs only through God’s power in Word and Gospel.
* Missionary consequence: Christ wills that his Spirit-filled disciples carry the Gospel with saving authority.
* Illustration: The pitiable condition of the Gentile world in body and soul.
* Christological center: Jesus’ love for lost souls overcomes all impurity.
* Ecclesiological claim: Christ imparts this same love to his disciples.
* Conclusion: The Church, as Christ’s Body, must share his longing and participate actively in his saving work.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 16:8 – conviction of sin, righteousness, judgment.
* John 6:44 – drawn by the Father.
* Philippians 3:12 – being apprehended by Christ.
* Matthew 8:25 – “Lord, save us, we perish.”
* Psalm 51 – the broken and contrite.
* 1 Corinthians 12 / Ephesians 1 – Church as the Body of Christ.
* Ephesians 4:1 – walking worthy of the calling.
* Great Commission (implicit).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* No softening of human inability or divine necessity.
* Retain urgency regarding perishing souls.
* Preserve contrast between human misery and Christ’s relentless love.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan jo ikke" – absolute inability.
* "maa" – necessity, not advisability.
* Conditional clauses must retain their binding force.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand → Spirit
* Synd → Sin
* Retfærdighed → Righteousness
* Dom → Judgment
* Frels(e) → Save / Salvation
* Sjæl(e) → Soul(s)
* Legeme → Body
* Længsel → Longing

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Breaking and shattering of the inner person.
* Gold/Diamond in filth metaphor retained verbatim in sense.
* Body as active instrument, not ornament.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity: human incapacity and judgment.
* Compassion: Christ’s love for the impure and lost.
* Exhortation: call to participate in Christ’s work.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve anaphora (“Blir vi ikke…”).
* Maintain long sentences where theological pressure accumulates.
* Retain rhetorical questions intact.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

But we cannot. No, we cannot—unless the Spirit of the Lord is granted to convict us of Sin and of Righteousness and of Judgment. If we are not drawn by the Father, if we are not called by the Spirit, if we are not seized by Christ, then our will does not bow itself beneath the will of Jesus. Something must be broken and shattered within us, if we are to become of those who are broken in spirit, who cry out: Lord, save us—we are perishing!

And this comes to pass only by the power of God through his Word and Gospel.

Therefore it is also the will of Jesus that his believing disciples, to whom he has given of his Spirit, should carry his Gospel forth among the peoples with saving power and authority, so that hearts may be laid hold of by the Lord, and thus may also lay hold of him.

Behold the great heathen world! Can anything more pitiable be conceived for one who knows life unto sin and unto grace? In body and in soul the heathen are miserably prepared. The pagan soul of the forefathers wears down the souls with demonic power, and diseases of every kind ravage the bodies. Uncleanness in every sense of the word makes them loathsome to all—except to him who gave his life for their salvation and deliverance. He knows the worth of souls; and just as the one who searches for gold or diamonds does not concern himself with the filth through which he must dig in order to find the treasure, so there is no uncleanness that can hold Jesus back, so that he should not seek the lost souls in order to save them.

And Jesus imparts his love to his disciples. In the hearts of his believers he awakens the same longing for human souls that drove him himself to a life of suffering and to death upon the cross for the sake of souls.

Or is not the congregation the Body of Christ? And for what has Christ his Body, if not to work according to his will? For what should the Body of Christ be destined, if not to spread the works of his love?

See, therefore there is so intimate a bond between the will of Jesus and his congregation. It is indeed the Body through which he works. And when the whole longing of Jesus is directed toward this one thing—that human souls might be saved—then it is this same longing that must thoroughly permeate us, if we are to walk worthy of the calling with which we have been called.

And in the power of this will of Jesus we can take part in his work; otherwise his Body would have to be dead and inactive. We can take part in sending the Gospel of salvation out over the earth, according to Jesus’ own command.
