STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Spedalskhed" used metaphorically for sin’s defilement; must retain biblical/doctrinal weight (leprosy imagery).
* "Urenhed" carries cultic-moral impurity, not mere dirtiness.
* "Forsoningslidelse" denotes atoning suffering; avoid vague "suffering."
* "Vilje" (Jesu Vilje) bears salvific authority; not mere preference.
* "Pleie" implies compassionate care, not medical technique.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic sentences with cumulative clauses and rhetorical pivots.
* Parallelism and repetition ("trods … trods … trods …").
* Rhetorical questions must remain intact and forceful.

Theological Hazards:

* Faith–salvation immediacy ("Den, som tror, er allerede frelst").
* Christ’s willingness vs. human refusal.
* Universal sufficiency of Christ’s will and atonement contrasted with unbelief.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Avoid smoothing lament and accusation ("I vilde ikke").

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* Healing of the leper echoes Gospel narratives (Matt 8; Mark 1; Luke 5).
* "Jeg vil, bliv ren!" — performative divine will; KJV-like cadence without archaic pronouns.
* "Din Tro har frelst dig" — direct biblical quotation formula.
* Hen and chicks image (Matt 23:37; Luke 13:34) — divine compassion rejected.
* "Samvittigheds manende Røst" — conscience as admonishing voice; retain moral pressure.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Jesus’ love reveals itself in pure, active compassion.
* Illustration: Healing of the leper.
* Doctrinal claim: Faith and salvation are inseparable.
* Normative claim: Jesus’ will is decisive for salvation and ministry.
* Problem: Persistence of suffering despite Christ’s will and power.
* Answer: Human refusal of Christ’s will.
* Conclusion: Necessity of submitting to Jesus’ will personally and ministerially.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Healing of the leper — Synoptic Gospels.
* "Your faith has saved you" — Gospel refrain (e.g., Luke 7:50; 8:48).
* Lament over Jerusalem — Matthew 23:37 / Luke 13:34.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp contrast between Christ’s willingness and human resistance.
* Preserve lament as accusation and grief.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" / "kommer an paa" — rendered as necessity and decisive dependence.
* "vil" — divine will as effective and authoritative.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Urenhed" → impurity
* "Spedalskhed" → leprosy (metaphorical when applied to sin)
* "Frelsen" → salvation
* "Vilje" → will

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Leprosy as sin retained without explanation.
* Hen and chicks image preserved verbatim.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Compassion → lament → exhortation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where argument accumulates.
* Rhetorical questions maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Jesus’ love reveals itself in all its purity and truth. The impurity of leprosy awakens no revulsion in him and arouses no disgust. He does not stand at a distance and offer his counsel; nor does he command another to give the leprous man the care he needs. No— with love’s perfect willingness, its zeal, indeed its joy, he stretches out his hand, touches the sick man, and says: “I will; be clean!” and the leper is already healed.

Thus faith and salvation belong together. The one who believes is already saved, just as Jesus was accustomed to say: Your faith has saved you.

Such is the will of Jesus. And it is this that everything depends upon. It is this will to which we must conform, if it is to go well for us and for our work.

It is the will of Jesus that all our impurity, the leprosy of our sin, should be taken away. Over against the whole suffering human race, with all its sin, all its wounds, all its pains, he stands ready and willing to help.

Why, then, are not all these suffering, sinful, impure people helped? Why is it that, despite Jesus’ will, despite his atoning suffering, despite his mighty power, there is still so much misery and lamentation in the world?

Oh, hear the answer to these questions from the mouth of Jesus, if you have not already heard it from the admonishing voice of your own conscience! Hear what he says: Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to you! How often I would have gathered your children together, just as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings! And you were not willing.

Can anything more shattering be conceived than this lament: How often I would—and you were not willing!

Therefore, we say, this is what it comes down to: that we submit ourselves under the will of Jesus, both for our own sake, for the sake of our personal salvation, and in all our work for the salvation of other people.
