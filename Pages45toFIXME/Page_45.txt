STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "spedalsk" — biblically charged term (leper), bearing ritual impurity and social exclusion; must retain scriptural resonance.
* "tilbød ham" — older usage meaning approached and paid homage/bowed, not "offered" in modern sense.
* "forvisset" — assured, inwardly convinced; stronger than mere opinion.
* "Stilling" — condition or state of being, not social position.
* "giøre" — make, effect a real transformation.
* "iafald" — at least, in any case; concessive nuance.
* "Bønnhørelsen / bønhoert" — being heard/answered by God; technical devotional term.
* "Aandens Øie" — the eye of the spirit; inward spiritual perception.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long cumulative sentences with sermonic pacing.
* Semicolon logic and causal connectors that must not be fragmented.
* Rhetorical repetition ("Bare han vil! Bare Jesus vil?").
* Embedded biblical citation integrated into argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Christ’s will as efficacious, sovereign, and gracious.
* Faith that both dares to ask and bows humbly.
* Prayer answered precisely because it accords with divine will.
* Implicit doctrine of regeneration/transformation.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, contemplative Lutheran sermon tone.
* Address to conscience and spiritual imagination.
* Risk of modernizing away solemnity or moral pressure.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Aabner for Aandens Øie" — evokes spiritual sight; cf. Eph. 1:18. Literal rendering required to preserve contemplative force.
* "Bare han vil!" — exclamatory, expressing the entire hope resting on Christ’s will.
* "Det synes noksom for stort til at tro" — faith strained by the magnitude of grace.
* "efter hans Vilje" — direct echo of 1 John 5:14; must retain biblical phrasing.
* "Den rette Læge" — Christ as the true physician; cf. Matt. 9:12.

KJV Parallels:

* Matthew 8:2–3 phrasing should follow familiar English Bible cadence without archaic pronouns.
* 1 John 5:15 logic preserved: asking, having, answered prayer.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Presentation of the biblical scene.
* Evocation of its spiritual vividness.
* Description of the leper’s misery and hope.
* Central hinge: Christ’s will as decisive.
* Affirmation of humble yet confident faith.
* Immediate divine response to prayer.
* Doctrinal conclusion: prayer according to God’s will is surely answered.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matthew 8:2–3 — explicit quotation.
* 1 John 5:15 — paraphrased citation regarding answered prayer.
* Implicit echoes: Eph. 1:18 (eyes of the heart), Matt. 9:12 (physician imagery).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain solemn wonder at Christ’s authority and mercy.
* Preserve earnest emphasis on the will of Jesus.
* Do not soften the immediacy or certainty of divine action.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan" and "vil" must remain strong: ability and will united.
* "Bare han vil" preserved as absolute necessity resting on Christ alone.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Vilje" — consistently rendered as "will."
* "Bøn" / "bønnhørelse" — prayer / being heard or answered.
* "ren" — clean, with ritual and spiritual overtones intact.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Leprosy as total corruption and exclusion.
* Healing as complete transformation, not partial improvement.
* Spiritual sight imagery retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Move from misery to hope, from uncertainty to certainty.
* Preserve contrast between human humility and divine immediacy.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained where reasoning accumulates.
* Rhetorical pauses and repetitions preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

subsection{Jesus’ Will}

\begin{quote}
And behold, a leper came, approached him and said: Lord, if you will, you can cleanse me. And Jesus stretched out his hand, touched him, and said: I will; be clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. Matt. 8:2–3.
\end{quote}


There can scarcely be conceived a more gripping scene than that which the above words of Scripture open to the eye of the spirit. A leprous man, helpless and unclean, loathsome to himself and to others, has been seized by the power and goodness of Jesus; he is assured that here is the true physician who can change his entire condition and make him a new person, at least in bodily respect. If only he wills it!

If only Jesus wills it? Yes indeed, he does will it. The leper does not doubt this either; yet he prays humbly through these words: Lord, if you will. It seems great enough to be beyond belief, and yet he believes it—that Jesus both can and will help him.

And scarcely has the prayer passed the leper’s lips before we become witnesses to the answer. It is as John writes in his epistle: we ask, and we have the things for which we have asked him. It takes no time at all to be answered in prayer where the prayer is according to his will.
