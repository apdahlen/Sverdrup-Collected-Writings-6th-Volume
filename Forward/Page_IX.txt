STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Bind" as volume, not binding.
* "Menigheden" in ecclesial sense (the congregation / the Church).
* "Forelæsningsrække" implying extended academic-ecclesial lectures.
* "Missionsmark" as missionary field, not market.
* "Hedningefolk" as heathen peoples, carrying 19th‑century missiological weight.
* "Velsignelse" in strong biblical sense of blessing.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with subordinate clauses.
* Parenthetical references to other volumes.
* Formal epistolary and editorial prose style.

Theological Hazards:

* Missiological language concerning divine calling and blessing.
* Ecclesial authority implied in church bodies and assemblies.

Voice Hazards:

* Editorial humility and reverence toward Sverdrup.
* Solemn gratitude and ecclesial seriousness.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "drog disse to Mænd sammen" – idiom meaning a shared calling or interest drew them together.
* "betragtede dette Telegram som en Skat" – metaphor of spiritual and personal value.
* "lægge sin Interesse for dette Arbeide for Dagen" – to show active, practical support.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Explanation of why supplemental material is included.
* Historical account of the 1892 mission agreement.
* Personal note on Sverdrup’s valuation of the telegram.
* Editorial hope for a future seventh volume.
* Expression of gratitude to supporters and publisher.
* Concluding benediction and signature.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* "Velsignelse" echoes biblical blessing language.
* Implicit vocational theology in mission language.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain dignified, respectful editorial tone.
* Avoid casual or modern phrasing.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve strong expressions of hope, obligation, and intention.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* "Mission" → mission
* "Velsignelse" → blessing

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Preserve "treasure" metaphor for the telegram.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Balance historical reporting with personal gratitude and hope.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain longer sentences and formal cadence appropriate to public reading.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

The students. Through an oversight these were not included in Volume II, on the Congregation, and are therefore published in this volume (pp. XIII–XVI) as a Supplement. The brief, concise, and pregnant manner of expression in these paragraphs finds its sufficient explanation in the circumstance that they formed the basic outlines for a longer series of lectures.

In 1892 an agreement was reached with the Norwegian Missionary Society to the effect that the Norwegian Lutherans in America should receive their mission field as their own mission field. (See Volume I, pp. 225 ff.) Professor Sverdrup and Pastor P. A. Rasmussen had been chosen to travel to Norway in order to attend the General Assembly in Stavanger, with the purpose of having this matter advanced. From many statements by Professor Sverdrup—several of which are found in Volume IV of the present work—one will understand how the interest of mission, notwithstanding differences of preference in other respects, drew these two men together. Professor Sverdrup was unable to travel to the General Assembly. But on the 12th of July, 1892, he received from Pastor Rasmussen a brief telegram, a facsimile of which is included in this volume, reporting that the Norwegian Lutherans in America had received as their mission field the region stretching from St. Augustine southward, comprising the two Zanoff tribes and the heathen peoples dwelling south of these. It is known to the editor that Professor Sverdrup regarded this telegram as a treasure, which he valued highly.

In conclusion, only this further word: It is my hope that Professor Sverdrup’s collected writings may eventually come to include also a seventh volume. I have envisioned that this should contain, first, a biographical sketch of the author, together with a characterization of his view of life and his fundamental Christian convictions. Next, a selection of letters. There undoubtedly exist not a few such hitherto unknown letters of considerable interest which those closest to Professor Sverdrup have been permitted to receive from him. A suitable selection would be of exceedingly great interest also to the general public. And should there still be room for more, in order to give this volume the same size as the others, there yet remains various material which ought to be published. I hope that there may be found men who are willing to undertake the not easy labor which the publication of a volume with the content here indicated would entail.

Finally, I wish to extend my sincere thanks to all who in various ways have shown their interest in this work. In particular it is a heartfelt need for me to thank Forretnings Boghandel and its manager, Mr. O. A. Sain, who not only made it possible for this relatively large and costly work to be published, but who has also shown me personally an unfailing goodwill and accommodation, which in a significant degree has lightened the labor of publication.

May Professor Sverdrup’s collected writings thus become a blessing, as their author himself is.
