STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Menigheden" (congregation/church) as a theological body, not merely an assembly.
* "Aandens Udgydelse" carries Pentecostal-biblical resonance (outpouring of the Spirit).
* "Lov" refers specifically to the Mosaic Law with covenantal force.
* "Salighed" denotes salvation/blessedness, not mere happiness.
* "Gjentomft" = second coming/advent, archaic spelling.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Extended hypotactic sentences with chained clauses and semicolon logic.
* Argument unfolds through cumulative subordinate clauses that must remain intact.
* Sermonic pacing; breaking into short sentences would flatten force.

Theological Hazards:

* Relation of Church to Mosaic Law (justification vs. ceremonial observance).
* New creation through the Spirit as constitutive of the Church.
* Distinction between Kingdom of God and Church without separating them.
* Eschatology: Second Coming, Final Judgment, Kingdom of Glory.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest doctrinal exposition with polemical edge.
* Danger of modern neutral tone erasing Lutheran confessional clarity.
* Addressed to theological conscience rather than casual reader.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gjøre alle Folk til hans Disciple" echoes Matt. 28:19; KJV: "make disciples of all nations."
* "nyt Samfund" carries covenantal-new-creation meaning, not sociological novelty.
* "Tegn og Symboler" recalls Pauline language (Rom., Gal.).
* "Livsstrøm" metaphor: organic, vital flow of divine life.
* "drage dem til Sønnen" echoes John 6:44 ("draw him").

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

§14:

* Historical premise: Church born by the Spirit among Jewish disciples.
* Problem raised: Is the Church merely reformed Judaism bound to Mosaic Law?
* Apostolic struggle resolves the issue.
* Doctrinal conclusion: Church is a new community grounded solely in faith in Christ and the Spirit’s new creation.
* Permanent consequence: No human laws or ceremonies may define the true Church.

§15:

* Initial clarification: Church can only be the Kingdom of God on earth.
* Conceptual distinction: Kingdom broader than Church.
* Enumeration of Kingdom’s wider workings (history, culture, governance).
* Central thesis: Church as the central life-stream of God’s Kingdom on earth.
* Eschatological conclusion: Church gives way to the Kingdom of Glory at Christ’s return.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Pentecost (Acts 2).
* Great Commission (Matt. 28:18–20).
* Pauline anti-legalism (Galatians, Romans).
* Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22–23; Col. 1:18).
* Drawing to the Son (John 6:44).
* Final Judgment and Kingdom of Glory (Matt. 25; Rev. 21–22).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain firmness against legalism.
* Preserve triumphal tone regarding apostolic victory.
* Maintain solemn eschatological gravity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "blir det uundgaaeligt" → "it becomes unavoidable."
* "maa" and logical necessity rendered without weakening.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden → the Church
* Aanden → the Spirit
* Lov → the Law
* Salighed → salvation
* Guds Rige → the Kingdom of God

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* "centrale Livsstrøm" retained as organic metaphor.
* "Arbeide, Kamp og Trængsel" preserved as triad.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Polemical clarity (§14) vs. expansive theological vision (§15).
* Present struggle contrasted with future rest and glory.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolon logic and accumulative clauses retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

§ 14. Since the Church came into being through the outpouring of the Spirit into the hearts of Jesus’ Jewish disciples, and since these received from Jesus the command to make all nations his disciples, it became unavoidable that already in apostolic times the question should be raised and decided whether the Church was only a form of the Jewish religious community modified by faith in the true Messiah, and whether therefore the Church was bound by the Law that had been given to the Jews, so that the Church could be recognized only by the observance of Jewish customs and ceremonies. And through the struggle which the resolution of this question required, there was secured for the Christian faith the great result that the Church is a new community, dependent solely upon faith in Jesus Christ and upon the new creation which consists in the Spirit’s communication of the new life, so that none of the signs and symbols, customs and ceremonies of the Jewish Law are binding upon the Church, nor, consequently, necessary for salvation. This glorious victory over all demands for the observance of the Law has for the Church in all ages the abiding significance that it is impossible to bind it by such regulations, laws, customs, ceremonies, and the like, as are devised by men, and to make these, or their observance, marks of the one true Church.

§ 15. The question whether the Kingdom of God or the Kingdom of Heaven is the same as the Church must, in the first place, be answered to the effect that the Church can be the Kingdom of God only upon the earth; and, in the second place, that even when we speak only of the Kingdom of God here upon earth or in the present world, the concept of the Kingdom of God is nevertheless wider than the concept of the Church, inasmuch as it includes not only the life of the Spirit in the hearts, which is the inmost essence of the Church, but also the preparatory and preserving divine government and guidance of the human race, and indeed also the manifold effects of divine revelation in the Gospel outside of and alongside the Church, in the life of the human intellect, in art, science, literature, forms of state, and the like; just as also the great secular transformations which take place in the world, and especially in the historical course of mankind through the coming of Christ, belong under the concept of the Kingdom of God. The relation between the Church and the Kingdom of God upon earth must therefore be determined thus, that the Church is the central life-stream in the Kingdom of God upon earth, alongside of which there are perceived divine workings of Spirit and power which indeed belong to the Kingdom of God, but nevertheless do not serve for the salvation of those who are affected by them, unless they become means to draw them to the Son and to his body, which is the Church. The course of the Church is brought to its close and fulfillment by the return of Christ and the final judgment, when the Kingdom of Glory, with its rest and blessedness, takes the place of the Church’s labor, struggle, and tribulation.
