STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Menigheden: must be rendered consistently as Congregation/Church with theological weight, not merely social gathering.
* Naademidlerne: Means of Grace in Lutheran doctrinal sense.
* Communio: technical ecclesiological term; must retain Latin or careful English equivalent.
* Beligering: archaic, metaphorical term meaning divine visitation/encompassment.
* Udgydelse: outpouring (Pentecostal-biblical language).
* Slægt: race/generation/human kind; must avoid modern racial connotations.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, clause-heavy sentences with doctrinal pivots.
* Parenthetical biblical citations embedded mid-sentence.
* Enumerations of effects (life, light, power, witness) that must remain parallel.

Theological Hazards:

* Trinitarian origin of the Church.
* Pneumatology: relation between Spirit, Christ, believers.
* Image of God, new creation, forgiveness of sins.
* Church as Body of Christ.

Voice Hazards:

* Dogmatic, confessional tone.
* Academic yet sermonic cadence.
* Must not be reduced to explanatory prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Naademidlerne har haft sin tilsigtede Virkning” – idiom for efficacious grace, not mere reception.
* Pentecost imagery (storm, fire, tongues) echoes Acts 2; must retain symbolic exposition.
* “Aandens Virksomhed” – activity/operation of the Spirit (classical theological diction).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* §1 rejects a reductionist ecclesiology grounded only in means of grace.
* §2 asserts divine, trinitarian origin of the Church at Pentecost.
* §3 explains experiential content of the Spirit’s outpouring.
* §4 concludes with doctrinal definition: Church as new creation within fallen world.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Acts 2 (Pentecost signs).
* John 14–17 (Paraclete promises, union with Christ).
* Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4–8 (promise of power from on high).
* Pauline Body-of-Christ imagery (1 Cor 12; Eph 1).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain dogmatic firmness.
* Preserve explanatory authority and theological confidence.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “er”, “blev”, “bestaar” must remain declarative and necessary, not tentative.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menigheden = Congregation (capitalized).
* Aanden = the Spirit / the Holy Spirit.
* Naade = Grace.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Storm, fire, light, body/head imagery retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Academic rejection → revelatory assertion → experiential description → doctrinal synthesis.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where the argument requires it.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

\section{Dogmatic Paragraphs on the Congregation}

§ 1. To treat the doctrine of the Congregation after the doctrine of the Means of Grace, in such a way that the Congregation would be “the society of men among whom the Means of Grace have had their intended effect” (Communio), does not correspond to the Trinitarian recognition of the coming-into-being of the Congregation, nor does it accord with the individual Christian’s experience of how he himself has been incorporated into the Congregation.

§ 2. The Congregation came into being through a divine act which is part of God’s revelation among men and belongs to the eternal counsel of salvation, which had in view the restoration of the human race from its fall. This divine act consists in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit\footnote{In the authors’ manuscript there stands “sending forth,” which may perhaps be a scribal error. — Ed.} into the hearts of Jesus’ disciples at the first (Jewish) Feast of Pentecost after Christ’s Ascension. The signs which accompanied the outpouring of the Spirit are such as reveal the nature of the Spirit’s activity and what it proclaims. The storm signifies the mighty power; the tongues of fire, the heavenly light; the foreign tongues, the spread among all peoples.

§ 3. The divine visitation which the outpouring of the Spirit brings upon Jesus’ believing disciples is, according to Jesus’ promise in the Gospel of John, chapters 14–17, the Gospel of Luke 24:49, and Acts 1:4–8, and according to the Trinitarian consciousness of the Spirit’s operation: new, divine life, and new, spiritual light, joined with the corresponding power for action and impulse to bear witness. Grace—the divine life which in its essence is love—and the spiritual light which is truth, proceed from the exalted and transfigured Jesus Christ, with whom the Spirit unites the believing disciples, so that they become His body, and He their Head.

§ 4. The Congregation is therefore, for Trinitarian recognition, a new creation, a new race which once more bears the image of God; yet not a new bodily human race alongside the old, but a renewal of the old race through the forgiveness of sins and the life of the Holy Spirit in the hearts, so that this society lives the renewed human life within the outward conditions of the fallen race, surrounded by sin in the flesh and in the world, and with temporal death as the regular, though not unavoidable, exit from the present world.
