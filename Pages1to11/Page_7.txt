STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Also in our missionary work in Madagascar it is the chief matter to build with full confidence upon this tried, divine promise. It has stood its test now for nearly four thousand years, since the day it was given to Abraham. It has proved its truth despite all the objections of unbelief and the mockery of men. Christ’s suffering shall have its reward, and His resurrection from the dead shall prove its victorious power. We may labor in perfect security, if we build our missionary work upon the immovable rock of the promise.

It is therefore the first greeting which our missionary journal desires to bring to its readers: Believe the promise, hold fast to it! Let all labor for the salvation of the Gentiles rest upon it. Only thus does the work become a work of God, in which His children are His instruments, whom He employs in His service for the salvation of souls. And only thus may we be fully assured that the work shall succeed, since it stands fast: “In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed”—and this seed of Abraham is Jesus Christ, who in and through His Gospel comes to souls as the Bread from heaven that giveth life unto the world.

Brethren and Sisters! it is a great and glorious calling to have a share in the work of the fulfillment of God’s counsel of salvation in the world. God will take us into His service as His fellow workers, that the Gospel may reach unto the ends of the earth. Eternal life and blessedness, and a fullness of blessings that follow therewith, the Lord will through His Church spread abroad over the earth among the wandering Gentiles. Us He calls to be His instruments. Shall we not all be obedient to His call and take up the work He entrusts to us with strength and zeal?

The Lord grant that none of those who have experienced the power of Christ’s death upon their heart may stand idle and inactive, when the Lord calls to manly deed and vigorous labor!
