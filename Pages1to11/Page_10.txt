STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "uagtet" (notwithstanding) – concessive force must be preserved.
* "Frelsens Grundlæggelse" – foundational establishment of salvation; not abstracted.
* "Graad" – weeping, penitential sorrow.
* "Løb" – race/course; Pauline metaphor.
* "Fødsels Smerte og Veer" – birth-pangs; biblical/eschatological image.
* "Hedningemissionsarbeidet" – Gentile mission work; ecclesial, not sociological.
* "Hvedekornet" – wheat grain; Johannine metaphor.
* "Nød og Trængsler" – affliction and tribulation.
* "Stridsmand" – warrior/combatant in spiritual warfare.
* "Besætninger" – strongholds/fortresses (demonic).
* "Stat" – power/estate/domain, not modern state.
* "Daarlighed" – folly/boasting in foolishness (Pauline irony).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long concessive openings must remain intact.
* Parallel rhetorical questions must not be flattened.
* Quoted Scripture embedded in prose.
* Accumulative suffering list requires rhythmic continuity.

Theological Hazards:

* Law–Gospel relation (Loven applies to work in God’s Kingdom).
* Necessity of suffering preceding joy.
* New birth imagery tied to mission.
* Spiritual warfare against the devil.
* Apostolic suffering as divine calling, not accident.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational tone.
* Refusal to sentimentalize suffering.
* Sermonic gravity and pastoral urgency.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "begynder med Graad, kan fuldende sit Løb med Glæde" – Psalmic/Pauline echo (Ps 126:5; 2 Tim 4:7).
* "Fødsels Smerte og Veer" – John 16:21; Romans 8.
* "lægge Hvedekornet … i ny Jordbund" – John 12:24.
* "Taareregn" – Psalmic imagery.
* "Stridsmand" – 2 Timothy 2:3–4.
* "Djævelens stærke Besætninger" – 2 Corinthians 10:4–5.
* "taler i Daarlighed" – 2 Corinthians 11:21.

Literal rendering without biblical register would obscure force.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Concession: truth known in conscience and experience.
* Difficulty: accepting law of suffering in God’s work.
* Principle: life comes through birth-pangs.
* Application: Gentile mission.
* Rhetorical questions denying painless mission.
* Assertion: suffering is necessary for both preacher and hearers.
* Scriptural warrant: Paul’s calling.
* Proof: Paul’s catalog of sufferings.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Psalm 126:5 – sowing in tears, reaping in joy.
* John 12:24 – wheat grain dying to bear fruit.
* Acts 9:15–16 – Paul as chosen instrument.
* 2 Corinthians 11:23–28 – sufferings list.
* Spiritual warfare motifs throughout.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

Warnings, necessity, and gravity retained.
No softening of pain or struggle.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as must.
* Impossibility questions preserved.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Salvation, Law, Kingdom of God, suffering, joy, Gospel used consistently.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Birth-pangs, wheat grain, warfare, throne imagery preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From sober reflection to sharp negation ("Nei").
* From doctrine to vivid apostolic testimony.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences retained.
* Accumulative clauses preserved.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

But notwithstanding that we have these things so clear and incontrovertible to our consciousness; notwithstanding that we see it so plainly, both in the whole laying of the foundation of salvation through Jesus, and in the individual soul’s experience of salvation, that only those who begin with weeping can complete their course with joy—yet it is nevertheless so difficult to reconcile ourselves to this, that the Law is the same also for all true labour in the Kingdom of God. It must begin with birth-pain and travail, if it is to attain unto the power of life and the joy that follows therefrom.

This applies not least to the work of Gentile missions. For it is nothing other than to lay the grain of wheat, Jesus Christ, into new soil, where it had not previously been sown. It is nothing other than that new life is created in the hearts of lost sinners through the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Can this take place without pain? Can it happen without a rain of tears?

No, of that there can be no question. Suffering must come; both the Christians who bear the Gospel out to the Gentiles, and the Gentiles who receive the Gospel among themselves, must suffer distress and tribulation, if the Kingdom of God is truly to be planted in new ground. He who preaches Christ among the Gentiles must suffer; for he is a warrior who advances against the devil’s strong fortresses. The Gentiles among whom the Kingdom of God is planted must suffer; for their strength is broken and their dominion taken from them, when the idols are overthrown and Christ is enthroned among them.

When Paul was called to be apostle to the Gentiles, the Lord says of him: “He is to me a chosen vessel, to bear my Name before Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel; for I will show him how much he must suffer for my Name’s sake.” And was it not abundantly fulfilled in Paul, that which was spoken concerning suffering? Hear how he himself bears witness thereto, when, as he says, he “speaks in foolishness”:

\begin{quote}
I have laboured more abundantly, received more stripes, been imprisoned more often, been oft in peril of death. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one. Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned; thrice I suffered shipwreck; a night and a day have I been in the deep. In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils from my own countrymen, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in labour and toil, often in watchings, in hunger and thirst, often in fastings, in cold and nakedness; beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the pressure of concern for all the congregations.
\end{quote}
