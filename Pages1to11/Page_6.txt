STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* Grundvold – foundational term with biblical resonance (cf. Eph. 2:20); must retain solidity imagery.
* Forjættelse – covenantal promise, not mere prediction; KJV-style "promise" required.
* Afkom – collective singular with Pauline Christological focus; must preserve singularity.
* Naade – grace as salvific economy, not sentiment.
* Hedninger – Gentiles (biblical term), not "pagans".
* Menighed – Church / congregation as covenant community.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, flowing sentences with semicolon logic and sermonic cadence.
* Parallel historical narration and theological interpretation intertwined.
* Embedded biblical citations and paraphrases.

Theological Hazards:

* Abrahamic promise interpreted Christologically (Gal. 3:16).
* Mission grounded in eternal decree (Frelsesraad).
* Universality of salvation without universalism.
* Justification, repentance, Spirit, Church cooperation.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Cosmic-historical scope tied to pastoral urgency.
* Avoid modern missiological jargon or abstraction.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Verdens Grundvold" – biblical idiom (Eph. 1:4), rendered "foundation of the world".
* "Tidens Fylde" – Gal. 4:4; "the fulness of time".
* "Vandre deres egne Veie" – biblical trope of rebellion.
* "Livsens Lugt til Liv" – 2 Cor. 2:16; KJV phrasing essential.
* "Aanden og Bruden siger: Kom" – Rev. 22:17.

Literal translation would flatten these; KJV-aligned diction preserves force.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Mission rests on an unshakable divine foundation.
* Grounding: The Abrahamic promise rooted in eternal divine counsel.
* Historical testing: Promise sustained through Israel’s history.
* Fulfillment: Christ as the promised Seed.
* Consequence: Universal mission to the nations.
* Present exhortation: Church and believers as God’s co-workers.
* Conclusion: Gospel as supreme blessing to the nations.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Gen. 22:18 – blessing to all nations.
* Gal. 3:16 – Seed as Christ.
* Acts 17:26–27 – appointed times and boundaries.
* Eph. 2:14 – middle wall of partition.
* Rev. 22:17 – Spirit and the Bride.
* Rom. 14:17 – righteousness, peace, joy in the Holy Ghost.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain gravity of divine counsel and judgment.
* Preserve earnestness regarding idolatry and human need.
* No softening of historical rebellion or salvific necessity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Preserve divine determination and necessity ("skulde", "maa").
* Avoid tentative or permissive English modals.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forjættelse – Promise
* Afkom – Seed
* Naade – Grace
* Aand – Spirit
* Menighed – Church

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Foundation imagery retained.
* Star shining in darkness preserved.
* Wall of partition imagery intact.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Judgment vs. mercy.
* Darkness vs. light.
* Waiting vs. fulfillment.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Maintain long sentences where theological weight accumulates.
* Preserve rhetorical pauses and flowing clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

\subsection{The Firm Foundation}

“In thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” Gen. 22:18.
“Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” Gal. 3:16.

The mission rests upon a firm and unshakable foundation, upon God’s faithful promise, which was spoken to Abraham and his Seed. Deep is this foundation laid; for the promise that was given to Abraham is grounded in that counsel of salvation which God purposed within Himself before the foundation of the world was laid, and which He revealed in the fulness of time in His own Son, our Lord Jesus Christ.

Long has this foundation already been tested in the history of mankind, without failing or being moved. For the promise was given to Abraham in that most ancient time when the nations were divided, and the Lord suffered them to walk in their own ways after the stubbornness of their evil hearts. The nations turned away from the living God and made themselves idols; they changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Yet God forgot not the nations; He determined for them appointed times and the bounds of their habitation, that they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him. And He also gave the promise to Abraham, that it should, through his lineage, in the people of Israel, and in the fulness of time, meet the need of the Gentile nations, when in the day of their distress they cried unto their idols and received no answer.

Through the two thousand years from Abraham unto Christ the Lord’s promise stood as a star shining in the darkness upon Israel’s heaven. Storms passed by, and clouds obscured it; yet the star was the same, and when the clouds were gone, it shone again with the same calm and clear light. What the promise had spoken concerning blessing for the nations in Abraham’s Seed was repeated and unfolded by the prophets, and ever more strongly and clearly did the divine counsel step forth, the nearer it drew toward the day of its fulfillment.

And the promised Seed of Abraham, who should be for a blessing unto all nations, came—Jesus Christ. The blessed kingdom of grace was founded by His death and resurrection. The middle wall of partition, which stood barring the way between Jews and Gentiles, was broken down. The Name was sent forth; the Gospel, in the very mother tongue of the nations, was laid near to their hearts and called them unto repentance and faith.

Since then the kingdom of God has spread from people to people, and the promise to Abraham is fulfilled continually from day to day. It is God’s eternal thought of peace with mankind that is being realized through the work of His Spirit and of His Church in the Gospel. For these are the days in which “the Spirit and the Bride say, Come! and let him that heareth say, Come!” God’s Church and each individual believer are “God’s fellow workers” in bringing forward that glorious day when the Gospel shall sound from sea to sea, among all peoples, unto the ends of the earth.

In this manner the Seed of Abraham becomes a blessing unto all nations. For there is no greater gift that can be rendered to the nations than the Gospel, which is a savour of life unto life for every one that believeth, and the kingdom of God, which is righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
