STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Sæd” – both literal seed and metaphor for spiritual sowing; must retain agricultural-biblical resonance.
* “Graad / Graad” – tears, weeping with penitential and afflictive weight, not mere sadness.
* “Fryderaab” – joy-cry, jubilant shout; stronger than simple joy.
* “Aandeligt Liv” – spiritual life in a theological sense, not psychological interiority.
* “Missionsarbeidet” – missionary labor as participation in God’s redemptive economy.
* “Forsagte” – fainthearted, inwardly broken by despair.
* “Smerte, Nød, Kval” – suffering with salvific and purifying connotations.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sermonic periods with conditional clauses and rhetorical questions.
* Parallel agricultural imagery extended across paragraphs.
* Embedded Scripture quotations woven into prose.

Theological Hazards:

* Law governing spiritual life (not moralism, but divine economy).
* Relation of suffering to fruitfulness in God’s Kingdom.
* Christ’s atoning suffering as the archetypal “seed.”

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience and faith.
* Risk of flattening solemn, pastoral urgency into neutral exposition.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “Taarerød bringer Glædeshøst” – proverbial condensation of Psalm 126; echoes sowing/harvest theology.
* Agricultural storm imagery – idiom for divine preparation rather than threat.
* “Hvedekornet” – John 12:24; must remain literal and metaphorical.
* “Udtømte sin Sjæl til Døden” – Isaiah 53:12; sacrificial exhaustion.
* KJV equivalents provide natural renderings for Psalms and Passion language.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Psalm 126 states the governing law of all spiritual life.
* Observation: Humans struggle to believe this law amid suffering.
* Illustration: The farmer rejoices at rain though it appears threatening.
* Application: God’s Kingdom advances through sorrow, not ease.
* Christological Center: Jesus as the supreme seed sown in suffering.
* Conclusion: His suffering yields immeasurable salvation and eternal praise.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Psalm 126:5–6 – explicit quotation.
* Psalm 65:9–10 – paraphrased in Davidic voice.
* John 12:24 – wheat grain dying to bear fruit.
* Hebrews 5:7 – prayers with strong crying and tears.
* Luke 22:44 – sweat like drops of blood.
* Isaiah 53:12 – poured out His soul unto death.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings against false optimism retained.
* Christ’s agony described without mitigation.
* Pastoral earnestness preserved.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “Skulde / maa” rendered as moral and theological necessity.
* No weakening into suggestion or probability.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Seed, sorrow, harvest, suffering, salvation, Kingdom of God rendered consistently.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Agricultural metaphors preserved throughout.
* No explanatory paraphrase replacing imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Movement from sorrow → confidence → Christ’s agony → exaltation preserved.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences and rhythmic clauses retained for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\subsection{Seed With Tears}

They that sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy. They go forth and weep, bearing the seed that they scatter; they shall come home with shouts of joy, bearing their sheaves.
Psalm 126:5–6.

These two verses of the Psalm lay down, simply and powerfully, the law for all spiritual life upon earth—most assuredly also for the work of missions. Yet we find it so difficult to appropriate this law that, although we hear it often and say it frequently—that seed sown in tears brings a harvest of joy—we are nevertheless each time equally discouraged and fainthearted when sorrow and distress press tears from our eyes.

It ought not to be so. Or does the farmer lose heart when the heavens darken over the newly sown field? When the clouds gather and stand like a threatening wall, when the storm breaks loose and sweeps on mighty wings across the fields? When the rain drips from heaven, first drop by drop, then thicker and thicker, until it pours down like a flood? Is it then that the farmer trembles with fear and thinks that all his labor has been in vain, that nothing but famine awaits him and his household? Ah no. He may indeed keep himself sheltered on the day of the storm, but through the window he gazes out, and his heart quivers with joy when he sees that the seed is being thoroughly soaked by the rain of heaven. Then he says with David: “Thou hast visited the earth and watered it; thou greatly enrichest it; the river of God is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it. Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly, thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers, thou blessest the springing thereof.”

As rain in the spring, so are sorrow and tears in the work of God’s Kingdom. Therefore, just as the farmer fears the clear sky and the unceasing sunshine once the seed has come into the ground, so also those who labor in God’s Kingdom ought to fear it when the beginning is bright and clear and everything succeeds at the first word. Deep must the ground be broken, and sore must suffering be endured, before golden fruit crowns the labor in God’s Kingdom.

All spiritual life among us, the whole blessed harvest of God’s Kingdom upon the great, broad field of the people and within the small, poor hearts of men, is altogether formed from the seed of pain which Jesus laid down through His suffering and death. All salvation for souls is a fruit of the heavy sufferings of Jesus Christ. As the psalmist says: “What Thou hast ploughed with such heaviness has become for us a harvest of joy.” It looked dark indeed, and it was immeasurable pain for Jesus when He was to become the grain of wheat that must be cast into the earth and die. “With strong crying and tears,” Scripture says, He offered up prayers and humble supplications in Gethsemane unto Him who was able to save Him from death. “And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” In such torment and tears Jesus became the seed-corn that was to bear life and blessedness for a lost race of mankind. But because He poured out His soul unto death and held nothing back from any suffering, therefore God has given Him glory and exaltation and made Him a Savior for a multitude which no man can number, who shall eternally praise His Name, because He suffered and strove and conquered in the anguish of death.
