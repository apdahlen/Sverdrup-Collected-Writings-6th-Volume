STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Saaledes" (thus/so) as logical continuation, not casual filler.
* "tragter efter" carries longing/aspiration, not mere preference.
* "velbehageligt" has sacrificial-pleasing connotations before God.
* "Troen" as living, saving faith, not assent.
* "Velsignelse / velsignet" active divine bestowal, not generic benefit.
* "Naaden" as unmerited grace in Christ with forensic and renewing force.
* "gjør alle Ting nye" echoing 2 Cor 5:17; must retain declarative force.
* "Trælletjeneste" bondage/slavish service, not simple labor.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological pivots.
* Colon and dash logic marking doctrinal explanation.
* Sermonic parallelism and accumulative clauses.
* Imperatives embedded in exhortational flow.

Theological Hazards:

* Faith oriented heavenward (Col 3:1–2).
* Justification and renewal through grace in Christ.
* Order of blessing before being a blessing (Abrahamic promise).
* Sanctification flowing from indwelling love of God by the Spirit.
* Mission as fruit of love, not legal compulsion.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest Lutheran exhortation to conscience.
* Warning against activism without received grace.
* Joyful yet solemn tone; must not be sentimentalized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "sætte ud" – nautical image: to set out on a voyage.
* "det ufjendte Land" – Abraham’s unknown land (Gen 12), faith-venture.
* "griber Redningsbaaden fra Himlen" – salvation imagery; must stay vivid.
* "vover alt paa Herrens Ord" – wagering one’s whole life on God’s promise.
* "Stans derfor her" – sermonic pause, rhetorical braking.
* "løb ikke forbi den" – do not skip the divinely given order.
* "hvad jeg har, det giver jeg dig" – Acts 3:6; KJV resonance required.
* "fastede i Havets Dyb" – sins cast into the depths (Micah 7:19).
* "Børnene, men ikke Trællene" – Johannine filial obedience vs bondage.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Faith is a heavenward setting-out patterned after Abraham.
* God delights in hearts loosed from earthly attachment.
* True faith grasps salvation and risks all on God’s Word.
* One must first be blessed before becoming a blessing.

* God’s love transforms perception of all people.
* From this renewal flows joyful, free service and mission.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Genesis 12:1–3 – Abraham called, blessed, made a blessing.

* 1 John 2:7–8; 3:18 – new commandment; love in deed and truth.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain earnest warnings and pauses.
* Preserve joy without softening doctrinal gravity.
* Maintain direct address and exhortational imperatives.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" rendered as "must" where necessity is doctrinal.
* Imperatives kept firm: "Stans," "løb ikke forbi."

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Tro = faith
* Naade = grace
* Velsignelse = blessing
* Kjærlighed = love
* Helligaand = Holy Ghost
* Syndernes Forladelse = forgiveness of sins

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Nautical, light, and creation-renewal metaphors retained.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* KJV-like cadence for Scripture echoes.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Thus we set out with Abraham toward the “unknown land,” and set our longing upon that which is above in heaven, not upon that which is on the earth. This is faith. And it is well-pleasing unto God when the heart no longer clings to anything earthly, but opens itself toward heaven and toward the spiritual things which the Gospel bears with it: righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Yea, there is joy in heaven when a soul that was on the point of sinking into the cold waves of sin and death lays hold of the lifeboat from heaven in a living faith and dares all upon the Lord’s word.

He who thus believes is blessed together with the believing Abraham. And it is precisely this that matters. It is not the first thing to be a blessing; the first thing is to become blessed. All newly converted souls indeed have this in common with one another, that they are eager to be a blessing to others at once, without delay. And it is surely the Spirit of God who works this zeal and longing. Yet not all the newly converted take time to prove themselves, whether they have indeed received the blessing.

Pause therefore here for a little while. The Lord says to Abraham: I will bless thee—and be thou a blessing. Behold, this is the right order; do not run past it! Think of Peter, who said to the lame man at the gate of the temple: Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee. There are surely some who attempt to give what they do not have. Wait until thou hast received the blessing, before thou seekest to give it.

What then is the blessing that we must receive before we can be a blessing to others? What else can it be than the grace in Christ—the grace which grants forgiveness of sins and makes all things new? Then indeed the old is passed away, when all our sins are forgiven and forgotten, yea, cast into the depths of the sea by God’s merciful grace, and peace is bestowed upon us undisturbed. And then indeed all things have become new, when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. For how wholly and entirely does not the love of God transform all things in and for a human being! How different does it appear in the heart when it is full of love; how different does it appear all around us when we behold men and life in the light of God’s love. Yea, truly all things are new then—whether it be our nearest ones, or our friends, or our enemies, our countrymen or distant heathen peoples; yea, all is so entirely transformed when God shows it to us in the light of His love.

Then also does a human being become a blessing to his fellow men. Then the light is kindled, and it shines for those who are in the house. And then it is no longer a servile bondage of forced works to spread light and peace and joy among men through God’s Gospel. Nay, it is a great joy of heart to be able to accomplish something for the cause of God’s kingdom on earth, so that ever more may come to taste the peace and the joy in Jesus Christ.

Be a blessing!—this is among the new commandments of which John speaks, which are not grievous, those that are given to the children, but not to the slaves. For God Himself gives the love; and if we truly love, then the commandment is already fulfilled. For he who loves, not with word only, neither with the tongue alone, but in deed and in truth, is already a blessing.

Let us follow in the footsteps of Abraham’s faith; then shall God bless us with true love, and we shall become a blessing also for the heathen peoples. For the mission to the heathen is a work of love, unto which God has called us and equipped us by His own Holy Ghost.
