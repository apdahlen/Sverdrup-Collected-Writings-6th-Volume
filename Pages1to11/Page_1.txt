STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* “Afsnit” (section) in older print culture—retain structural gravity, not modern casualness.
* “Missionsbetragtninger” carries devotional–theological weight; not mere “reflections.”
* “Frikirkes” in 19th‑century Lutheran usage—avoid modern free‑church connotations.
* “Gaaseren” as a periodical title—retain original name.
* “Grundvold” (foundation) with biblical resonance (cf. 1 Cor. 3).
* “Menighed” as both congregation and spiritual body.
* “Troskab” with covenantal fidelity, not generic faithfulness.
* “Forbillede” as moral–spiritual exemplar.
* “Vandel” meaning lived walk before God.
* “Forbandelse” and “Velsignelse” as covenantal states, not emotional conditions.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with embedded clauses and editorial asides.
* Paratactic rhythm suited for proclamation.
* Colon/semicolon logic that should not be broken into short modern sentences.
* Scripture quotations integrated into argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Abraham as archetype of faith (Rom. 4; Gal. 3; Heb. 11).
* Calling, obedience, blessing, curse—covenantal categories.
* Heart as the wellspring of life (Prov. 4:23 echo).
* Fruit/tree imagery from Christ’s teaching—must remain sharp.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone addressed to conscience.
* Editorial preface with ecclesial seriousness.
* Avoid smoothing into neutral academic prose.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* “lægge en god Grundvold” — biblical idiom; KJV: “lay a foundation.”
* “bygge paa Guds Ord” — Pauline metaphor; faithfulness to Scripture.
* “Hjemmets Menighed” — the household as a locus of churchly life.
* “Vær Velsignelse!” — imperative echoing Gen. 12:2; not merely ‘be a blessing’ but a calling to mediating blessing.
* “Tro og Wandel” — classic Lutheran pairing (faith and walk).
* Tree/fruit sayings — Matt. 7:17–18; Luke 6:43–44; KJV diction fits naturally.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Editorial rationale: purpose and authority of the writings.
* Scriptural thesis: God’s word to Abraham.
* Doctrinal claim: Abraham as father and exemplar of believers.
* Universal application: his calling applies to all Christians.
* Anthropological dichotomy: two ways of living.
* Moral consequence: life becomes blessing or curse.
* Christological grounding: Jesus’ teaching on tree and fruit.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Genesis 12:1–2 quoted directly.
* Abraham as father of believers — Rom. 4:11–12.
* Heart as source of life — Prov. 4:23 (implicit).
* Tree and fruit — Matt. 7:17–20; Luke 6:43.
* KJV phrasing suitable for all echoes.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain moral seriousness: blessing vs. curse.
* Preserve exhortational clarity without softening.
* Keep didactic firmness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* “skal” / “kan” / “kommer an paa” — retain necessity and consequence.
* Imperative “Vær Velsignelse!” remains strong.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Velsignelse = blessing
* Forbandelse = curse
* Tro = faith
* Vandel = walk
* Menighed = congregation

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Foundation/building metaphors intact.
* Tree/fruit imagery untouched.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Editorial calm → Scriptural authority → Moral warning.
* Do not flatten contrasts.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and balanced clauses.
* Maintain sermon-like flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\serction{First Section}

\textbf{Missionary Meditations}
———

[The following Missionary Meditations were in their time published in the Lutheran Free Church’s mission periodical, “Gaaseren,” whose first editor was Professor Sverdrup. It lay greatly upon his heart to lay a good foundation for missionary interest and missionary labor within the home congregation. Therefore he built, with unfailing faithfulness, upon the Word of God. It may therefore with certainty be said that these meditations contain much true missionary wisdom. For this reason, and in the hope that they may prove a welcome addition to the not overly large selection of sound missionary reading both for home and congregation, they are now issued together. In this edition they have been arranged according to the sequence in which the texts employed are found in the Bible.—Ed.]

\subsection{Be thou a Blessing!}

When the Lord said to Abraham: Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will shew thee! And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing! Gen. 12:1–2.

Abraham is the father of believers, and his faith and walk are for us all an example upon which we are to fix our eyes. All that is said concerning Abraham’s calling and obedience therefore has its application to all Christians.

In truth there are only two ways in which a human being can live. And according as he lives in the one way or in the other, his life becomes either a curse or a blessing. It depends upon the heart, from which life proceeds. As Jesus says: A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt.
