STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Frelsen", "Naade", "Kjærlighed", "Syndesorg", "Skyldbevidsthed", "Legedom" carry doctrinal weight and biblical resonance; avoid modern dilution.
* Agricultural metaphors ("Udsæd", "Høst", "Vaars Dag") must remain concrete and scriptural.
* "Lyksalighed" and "Pine" risk sentimental or weakened renderings if modernized.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, chained clauses with sermonic pacing; do not fragment.
* Parallel contrasts (joy/suffering; strength/defeat) must be preserved.
* Semicolon logic and cumulative exhortation require careful cadence.

Theological Hazards:

* Repentance, breaking of self-strength, spiritual death and life must retain Lutheran clarity.
* The necessity of contrition prior to grace must not be softened.
* Judgment imagery (fire, drought) must remain severe.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn exhortational tone addressing conscience; avoid smoothing.
* Retain gravity, warning, and pastoral urgency.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Glædes-høst af Lidelses Udsæd" — joy as harvest from suffering; echoes Psalm 126.
* "Ve eder" — prophetic woe; Luke 6:25 (KJV diction appropriate).
* "modnes for Ilden" — ripening for judgment; eschatological warning.
* "aandelige Tørkes Dage" — spiritual drought; biblical desolation imagery.
* KJV equivalents: "Woe unto you," "they that sow in tears shall reap in joy."

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Salvation and true joy arise from suffering and contrition, not earthly happiness or strength.
* Contrast: False paths (laughter, prosperity, self-satisfaction) versus true path (brokenness).
* Doctrinal assertion: Christian life begins with defeat of natural powers.
* Warning: Apparent good days may be spiritually deadly.
* Consolation: God’s Word takes root in contrite hearts.
* Conclusion: Scriptural promise of joyful harvest after tears.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Luke 6:25 — "Woe unto you that laugh now."
* Psalm 126:5–6 — sowing in tears, reaping with joy.
* Parable of the sower — seed sinking into prepared soil.
* Judgment by fire — Malachi / New Testament imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain sharp warnings and contrasts.
* Preserve earnest pastoral exhortation.
* No sentimental consolation without prior severity.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and impossibility must remain strong ("did not," "could not," "must").
* No weakening of conditions for salvation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Frelsen → salvation
* Naade → grace
* Syndesorg → sorrow for sin
* Skyldbevidsthed → consciousness of guilt
* Legedom → healing

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Agricultural cycle (sowing, harvest, spring) preserved.
* Drought and fire imagery retained.
* Bodily imagery (bent to the knee) maintained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity (woe, judgment) contrasted with hope (spring, harvest).
* Avoid tonal flattening.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhythmic balance.
* Maintain proclamation-ready flow.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

And as it is with Jesus and the salvation that is in Him—that the great harvest of joy has come forth from the great sowing of suffering—so it is also with each and every one of us who now praise God for salvation and life. We did not win salvation in bliss and gladness. Experience shows far more the truth of that word which the Lord speaks: Woe unto you that laugh now, for ye shall mourn and weep. From the sowing of laughter and bliss there grows bitter sorrow and everlasting torment.

Neither did we win salvation by labor and toil, by vigorous struggle and glittering crowns of victory. It availed nothing unto salvation that much work was done and much was renounced and even much was prayed, so long as our own power was not broken and our own strength not shattered. The Christian life does not begin with the victory of the natural powers, but with their total defeat. And it is a day of weeping and sorrow when a strong man is bowed to his knees by sorrow for sin and by consciousness of guilt. Yet it is a good day, because it is the springtime—the day of spiritual spring—on which the living seed of God’s Word sinks deep into the soil of the heart and finds a well-prepared place where it may grow.

Far otherwise are the evil days for a man when all seems light and joy, when fortune smiles and wealth increases, and the smile of self-satisfaction spreads across a fat face. These are the days of spiritual drought, when spiritual life withers away and disappears, and a man ripens for the fire.

There must be spiritual humility of heart in order to receive the help of God’s grace and love; there must be brokenness in order to experience God’s healing. Therefore every Christian has a thorough experience of this precious word: They that sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy.
