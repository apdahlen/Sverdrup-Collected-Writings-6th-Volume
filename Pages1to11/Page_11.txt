STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hedninger" – carries biblical weight (Gentiles), not merely "pagans."
* "Menigheder" – congregations/assemblies, ecclesial sense.
* "Trængsler" – tribulations, afflictions with biblical resonance.
* "Forsage" – despair / lose heart, not merely "give up."
* "Frimodige" – bold, confident in faith, not casual courage.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with parallel clauses and sermonic buildup.
* Rhetorical questions embedded within argumentation.
* Use of em-dash pivots and balanced contrasts.

Theological Hazards:

* Martyrdom as seed of the Church.
* Divine judgment on resistance to the Gospel.
* Suffering as ordained means in God’s redemptive work.
* Biblical sowing/reaping imagery tied to hope.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, exhortational tone addressing conscience and faith.
* Warning language must not be softened.
* Elevated devotional prose must not be modernized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Hvor Aadselet er, der skal Gribbene samles" – direct echo of Matt. 24:28 / Luke 17:37; KJV diction required.
* "Saa med Graad, høste med Fryderaab" – Psalm 126:5–6; sowing in tears.
* "Morgenrøde" and "Spirer" – organic metaphors for Church’s beginnings.
* "Mørke og Lys" – Johannine dualism.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Early Church: suffering of Gentile converts → growth through martyrdom.
* Opponents of Gospel: divine judgment exemplified by Rome.
* Contemporary example: China as modern parallel.
* Eschatological confidence: Gospel will prevail through tribulation.
* Application: encouragement for Madagascar mission.
* Concluding exhortation grounded in Psalm imagery.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Matt. 24:28 – judgment proverb.
* Psalm 126:5–6 – sowing and reaping motif.
* Implicit Acts narrative of Church growth under persecution.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain stark descriptions of blood, tears, death.
* Maintain certainty of judgment and hope.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and certainty ("skal," "kan ikke") rendered as "shall," "cannot."

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Trængsler → tribulations
* Evangeliet → the Gospel
* Menighed → congregation / Church (contextual)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Blood as watering roots.
* Springtime storms over seed.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward opponents.
* Consolation toward suffering believers.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and rhythmic clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

And the Gentiles among whom the Gospel was first spread—what shall we say of them and of their suffering? These bleeding congregations on the one hand, how unspeakably must they not have suffered year after year, century after century? If the Church was founded by the death of the Saviour, then surely its roots were watered with the blood of martyrs. Bloody was the dawn of the congregation, and tear-bedewed were its tender shoots. No wonder that it grew quickly and flourished well and spread far and wide.

—And on the other hand, who can portray or paint the sufferings of those who set themselves against the Gospel? The Roman Empire and its heathenism sank into ruin under the most violent and dreadful tribulations. It is not possible to defy the Lord and His goodness without judgment coming; for where the carcase is, there will the viultures be gathered together.

And in the most recent times we have the example of China. The world studies with horror the scenes which China’s latest mission history sets before us. Blood and tears moisten page after page of this history. Missionaries and native Christians—tortured, abused, beaten to death—until their number and their agonies call to mind the terrors of the ancient persecutions of the Christians. And heathen Chinese—slaughtered, burned in their houses, beheaded, driven to suicide; thousands and yet thousands of them have become the prey of death because of the conflict between darkness and light.

But just as the Roman Empire was permeated by the Gospel through many and long tribulations, so it shall now go with the Chinese Empire. Its walls are burst and fallen, and the Gospel of Christ can no longer be kept out. The seed is already growing in many places, and the harvest will come richly blessed through the tribulations. Much yet remains to be suffered; but the outcome is sure; for they that sow in tears shall reap with shouts of joy.

It is therefore right to hope for good when one suffers evil in the work of God’s kingdom. And what is said of all such work applies also to our little mission work in Madagascar. It has had its tribulations, and many tears have flowed also over this work. Sorrow and distress have followed it and follow it still. But that is no reason to lose heart. It must have its springtime with showers and storms over the seed. We must grieve over our losses, but we must be bold in our work and in our tribulations; for it is the Lord’s way.

Now we go and weep, bearing the seed which we scatter; let us be faithful therein. That is the right way to sow. Only that which is sown in this manner will bear good fruit. Therefore, while we suffer, let us be glad in hope; for the day comes when he that sowed with tears shall come home with shouts of joy, bearing his sheaves.
