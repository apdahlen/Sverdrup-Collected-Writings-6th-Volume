STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "velsignet / Velsignelse" – carries strong biblical and covenantal weight; must not be reduced to mere happiness or success.
* "Tro" – faith in the Pauline–Lutheran sense (fiducia), not generic belief.
* "Wandel" – denotes manner of life or walk before God, with biblical resonance.
* "artede sig" – means how faith takes shape or manifests itself; not merely behavior.
* "forkrænkelige" – perishable, corruptible; biblical term (cf. 1 Cor. 15).
* "kjødelige" – fleshly in theological sense, not bodily or physical.
* "Naade alene" – sola gratia; doctrinally decisive.
* "snævre Port / trange Vei" – fixed biblical metaphors (Matt. 7:13–14).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, sermon-style sentences with parallel clauses ("baade … baade …").
* Rhetorical progression built through repetition rather than concise argument.
* Conditional constructions that must retain logical force.
* Sermonic cadence that should not be broken into short modern sentences.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of repentance as renunciation of world and self.
* Justification by grace alone for Christ’s sake.
* Contrast between visible/temporal and invisible/eternal.
* Anthropology: old worldly/fleshly nature versus faith’s new being.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational Lutheran tone addressing conscience.
* Warning against self-righteousness and worldly security.
* Earnest, pastoral seriousness that must not be softened or sentimentalized.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "være til Velsignelse" – biblical idiom (Gen. 12); means being a means through which God blesses others.
* "sige Farvel til Verden" – pietistic expression for repentance and renunciation.
* "det nytter ikke" – rhetorical dismissal; must retain firmness.
* "nøgne og fattige" – spiritual poverty (cf. Matt. 5:3; Rev. 3:17).
* "Troen er en fast Overbevisning om det, som ikke sees" – echo of Heb. 11:1.
* KJV-style equivalents are especially fitting for Hebrews, Matthew, and Pauline echoes.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening question: How can heart and life be blessed by God?
* Principle: Only the blessed can be a blessing; good works require renewed persons.
* Thesis: Abraham is the model of true faith.
* Explanation: Abraham’s faith involved loss and gain, renunciation and reception.
* Application: The same pattern must occur in believers.
* Elaboration: Abraham’s call to leave land and family.
* Doctrinal application: Necessity of breaking with world and self.
* Theological contrast: Visible/perishable vs. invisible/eternal.
* Conclusion: Entry into salvation only through grace, poverty of spirit, and the narrow way.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Genesis 12:1 – Abraham leaving land, kindred, father’s house.
* Hebrews 11:1 – definition of faith.
* Matthew 6:33 – kingdom of God and His righteousness.
* Matthew 7:13–14 – narrow gate and difficult way.
* 1 John 2:16–17 – world and its lust passing away.
* Revelation 3:17 – naked, poor, wretched imagery.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Warnings against worldly religion must remain sharp.
* Calls to renunciation must remain absolute, not advisory.
* The tone of spiritual necessity must be preserved throughout.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa" → must
* "kan ikke" → cannot
* "nytter ikke" → it avails nothing
* Conditional necessity must not be weakened.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Tro → Faith
* Verden → the world
* Naade → grace
* Frelse → salvation
* Retfærdighed → righteousness
* Liv → life (eternal where context demands)

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Losing and gaining; leaving and receiving.
* Narrow gate and difficult way.
* Old nature versus new being of faith.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in renunciation.
* Sobriety in doctrinal teaching.
* Hope implicit in promise of life and blessing.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve parallelisms and rhythmic clauses.
* Maintain sermonic flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

How, then, can our heart and our life be blessed by God?
This is the question for us all; for only when we ourselves are blessed can we also be a blessing. Only when we become good can we do good; it avails nothing to demand good works from evil men.

We have said that Abraham is our pattern in his faith. And in Abraham’s life and walk we can see the true nature and manner of faith. We cannot be Abraham’s children and at the same time possess a faith that takes shape in a manner different from Abraham’s. But if, in Abraham, faith so ordered itself that he both lost and gained, both forfeited and received, both let go and was given—then in a like manner it must go with us, if we are to become true children of Abraham and thus a blessing among men.

Abraham had to leave his land and his kindred and his father’s house, and go to the land which the Lord would show him.

This is the true beginning for us all who would walk in the footsteps of Abraham and become real and genuine friends of missions. We must bid farewell to the world and to all that is our own. Without the break with the old, there is no room for the new being of faith. The old worldly and fleshly being consists in loving the world and loving oneself, in craving perishable and earthly things and seeking one’s own—one’s own honor, advantage, and pleasure. This has nothing to do with faith; for faith is a sure conviction of things not seen. Faith occupies itself with the invisible and eternal things. Therefore there is also no salvation or eternal life to be found in visible and earthly things; for the visible things are perishable, and the world passeth away with its lust.

If, then, anyone would belong to Christ and have a share in the kingdom of God and His righteousness, he must bid farewell to the world and to himself, leave all things, and seek salvation by grace alone for Jesus’ sake. All our boasting and all our glory, all our delight and all our merit are gone, when we come naked and poor, wretched and miserable, to the Cross, to receive the forgiveness of sins, and through the narrow gate enter upon the difficult way that leadeth unto life.
