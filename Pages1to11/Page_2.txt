STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Forbandelse / Velsignelse" – covenantal, biblical terms (curse/blessing), not mere misfortune or kindness.
* "Kjødet" – Pauline term (the flesh), ethical-theological, not simply the body.
* "Fordærvelse" – corruption/destruction with moral-spiritual weight (Gal. 6:8).
* "Verdsligt" – worldly in the spiritual sense, not neutral secularity.
* "Vanartro Sind" – depraved or corrupted disposition, not intellectual unbelief alone.
* "Trældom" – bondage/slavery in Pauline-Lutheran law–gospel theology.
* "Forjættelse" – promise in the Abrahamic-redemptive sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, cumulative sentences with sermonic pacing.
* Parallel negations and concessions ("og dog … men det gaar ikke").
* Embedded biblical quotations that must remain syntactically visible.
* Rhetorical contrast clauses that should not be modernized or simplified.

Theological Hazards:

* Law vs. Gospel distinction (Law produces bondage; promise produces inheritance).
* Abrahamic blessing motif (Gen. 12; Gal. 3).
* Critique of works-righteousness (alms, mission gifts).
* Flesh vs. Spirit anthropology.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, pastoral warning tone.
* Address to conscience rather than abstract argument.
* Moral urgency that must not be softened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "leve efter Kjødet" – Pauline idiom (Rom. 8; Gal. 5); KJV: "live after the flesh."
* "høster Fordærvelse af Kjødet" – direct echo of Gal. 6:8 (KJV: "reap corruption").
* "kalkede Grave" – Matt. 23:27 (KJV: "whited sepulchres").
* "ufiendtlige Grave" – Luke 11:44 (KJV: "graves which appear not").
* "Lovprædiken" – preaching of the Law apart from Gospel.
* "føder til Trældom" – Gal. 4:24 (KJV: "gendereth to bondage").
* "den frie Kvindes Søn" – Isaac vs. Ishmael (Gal. 4).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening concession: No one consciously plans a cursed life.
* Exposure of self-deception: living after desire while imagining oneself a blessing.
* Refutation: good deeds cannot repair the harm of a fleshly life.
* Christological illustration: Pharisees as whited sepulchres.
* Homiletical principle: one cannot exhort people to bless without first teaching how to receive blessing.
* Law–Gospel pivot: Law alone produces bondage.
* Abrahamic conclusion: only the son of promise inherits blessing.
* Application to missions: danger of substituting money for repentance.
* Final thesis: receiving God’s blessing is the necessary foundation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Galatians 6:8 – sowing and reaping corruption.
* Matthew 23:27 – whited sepulchres.
* Luke 11:44 – unseen graves.
* Galatians 4:21–31 – bondage vs. freedom; son of the freewoman.
* Genesis 12:3 – Abraham as blessing to the nations.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain direct moral warning.
* Preserve polemical edge against complacent religiosity.
* Maintain seriousness regarding spiritual peril.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "det gaar ikke" – rendered as categorical impossibility ("it cannot be so").
* "maa" – preserved as necessity ("must").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forbandelse – curse
* Velsignelse – blessing
* Kjødet – the flesh
* Trældom – bondage
* Forjættelse – promise

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Keep agricultural metaphor (sowing/reaping).
* Preserve grave imagery without explanation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in warning sections.
* Doctrinal clarity in Law–Gospel section.
* Earnest pastoral correction in mission application.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences where exhortational flow requires.
* Use semicolons and balanced clauses.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Now there is, of course, no earnest man or woman who desires to live a life unto curse for himself and for others. When we set ourselves to lay out a plan for our life, we surely do not resolve to live unto curse. And yet there are many, many people who deceive themselves at this point. They live heedlessly according to their own desire and inclination, which Scripture calls to live after the flesh; and they do not consider that they “reap corruption of the flesh,” both for themselves and for others. They do not take the matter seriously, but imagine that they can live a self-seeking, worldly, and vain life, and then by a few alms to the poor or some gifts to the mission still become a blessing to other people, even though they themselves should become a curse.

But it cannot be so; there is no true blessing in such a life. A worldly and fleshly person cannot, by a few so‑called “good works,” restore anything of the harm he does among men by his worldly manner of life and his corrupted disposition. With such people it goes as Jesus says of the Pharisees: they are like whited sepulchres, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness; or they are “like the graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.”

Therefore it will not do to preach among men and say: Be a blessing! be a blessing! if one does not at the same time show them how they themselves may receive blessing. First we must receive, and then we can give. Without this, all becomes nothing but preaching of the Law, without power to bring forth anything but bondage. For it is the power of the Law that it “gendereth to bondage.” But the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir of the promise unto blessing for the nations; no, the son of the freewoman is the heir; in him shall all the families of the earth be blessed.

It is not altogether free from error that there is a certain misdirection in our work for the heathen mission at this point. There is so much talk of mission offerings, and relatively so little talk of a missionary mind. Hence there easily creeps in the false notion that in the heathen mission one may be a blessing with one’s money, even though one continues unto curse with one’s fleshly life. But if we are to “be a blessing” like Abraham, it is also necessary that we ourselves receive blessing from God. And this is the chief matter, because it is the beginning and the foundation, without which it is impossible to be a blessing.
