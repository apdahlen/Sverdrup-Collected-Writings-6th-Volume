STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Naadens Aar" – Jubilee/grace year; must not be reduced to generic “year of grace” without biblical resonance.
* "sagtmodige" – meek, gentle, afflicted; carries Matthew 5 resonance.
* "forbinde" – to bind up, heal; biblical/Isaiah diction.
* "Opladelse" – opening, release; archaic legal-spiritual term.
* "Menighed" – congregation/church as Christ’s body, not merely gathering.
* "Salvet" – anointed; Messianic and Spirit-bestowal sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological buildup.
* Parallel clauses reflecting Isaiah 61; must be preserved.
* Sermonic imperatives and rhetorical questions.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of Holy Spirit as sole source of faith.
* Ecclesiology: Church as Christ’s body united by the Spirit.
* Means of grace: Gospel, Incarnation, Christmas.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Appeals to conscience and self-examination.
* Must not modernize into reflective essay style.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* Isaiah 61:1–2 quoted nearly verbatim – align with KJV diction.
* "Begynd med Begyndelsen" – proverbial exhortation; keep aphoristic force.
* "Det staar ikke til den, som vil" – Romans 9:16 echo.
* Christmas imagery (manger, shepherds, Simeon) – Luke 2 allusions.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Wherever God’s Spirit is, there is life and mission.
* Doctrinal grounding: No Christian or church without the Spirit.
* Exhortation: Examine calling and task.
* Application: New Year not about resolutions but receiving the Spirit.
* Means: Gospel of Christ’s birth.
* Conclusion: Spirit received = anointing of divine love.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Isaiah 61:1–2 (primary text).
* Romans 9:16.
* Luke 2:15–32 (Shepherds, Simeon).
* 2 Corinthians 9:15 ("God’s unspeakable gift").
* Romans 5:5 (love of God poured into hearts by the Holy Spirit).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain probing questions and firm assertions.
* No softening of exclusivity of Spirit’s work.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan ikke", "kun", "maa" → must, cannot, only.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand = Spirit
* Salvet = anointed
* Menighed = congregation/church
* Naade = grace

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Spirit knocking at heart’s door.
* Anointing as love poured out.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning → invitation → consolation.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Preserve long sentences and parallelism.

STEP 11: FINAL TRANSLATION

\subsection{A Year of Grace from the Lord}

The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn. Isa. 61:1–2.

There cannot be the Spirit of God in a human being without there arising life and labor—most especially that labor which is portrayed in the two foregoing verses of the sixty-first chapter of the prophet Isaiah. And this, indeed, is precisely what is called missionary work.

But now it is also thus: no human being can be a Christian, and no society or fellowship can be a congregation, unless it has the Spirit of God. For no one is a Christian who does not have faith; yet no one has faith unless it is wrought by the Holy Spirit; and no fellowship is the Body of Christ, which is the congregation, unless by the Holy Spirit it is united with the Head, who is Christ.

If, therefore, anyone confesses himself to be a Christian, or if a gathering of people confesses itself to be a congregation, then let them reflect upon their calling and their task. The prophet Isaiah here paints it gloriously, both for the individual and for the congregation.

Begin with the beginning! In all things this is important, but most of all in Christian matters. What is required is to be able to say in truth: “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD hath anointed me.”

Have we the Spirit of the Lord GOD? Are we anointed of the Lord? For only he has the Spirit of the Lord who is anointed of the Lord. In this respect it is true: of thyself thou canst take nothing; all thou canst receive from God. And again: it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that showeth mercy.

Therefore it is not for us a question of new resolutions and new promises on New Year’s Day. It is a question of the Spirit of God and the power of God. And we cannot put this question away from us by saying that we cannot reach so high or grasp so far, that it is impossible to attain unto the Spirit of God. For the Spirit of God is given freely and without price from God. Yea, more than this: the Spirit of God works upon our hearts in order to enter in, knocks at the door of the heart to have it opened. We can receive the Spirit of God if we open to him and give him room.

If we have used Christmas and the Christmas Gospel rightly, then it should be so with us now at the New Year that we could in truth say: “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD hath anointed me.” For no other means are required in order to receive the Spirit from God than precisely that blessed Gospel of the Savior who is born in Bethlehem. There is Spirit to be received at Christ’s manger. Hast thou been with the shepherds in Bethlehem and seen “this thing which is come to pass”? Hast thou, with the aged Simeon in the temple, “taken the child into thine arms”? Then thou hast also experienced what “the unspeakable gift of God” is, and thou hast been laid hold of by God’s love toward poor human beings, and hast learned to praise the Lord, who in his Son has given us eternal life.

But then thou hast received the Spirit from God. Then thou art anointed of the Lord. For this anointing is precisely the love of God poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is given unto us.
