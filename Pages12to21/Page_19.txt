STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Naadens Aar" – biblical phrase (Luke 4:19 / Isaiah 61), must not be reduced to "year of grace" in a casual sense.
* "salige" – more than "happy"; denotes blessedness unto salvation.
* "Faderhuset" – Johannine/Lukan imagery; not merely "home".
* "Nadvere" – eschatological banquet imagery; not modern "dinner".
* "Hedninger" – 19th‑century missional term; must be rendered carefully without modern dilution.
* "Aand" – Holy Spirit; capitalized and theologically precise.
* "Forsætters Kraft" – human resolutions or intentions; moralistic danger if mistranslated.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long, flowing sermon sentences with coordinated infinitives.
* Rhetorical questions embedded in exhortation.
* Parallel lists that build cumulative force.
* Clause-heavy exhortational cadence that should not be broken up.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of salvation, repentance, mission, and eschatological urgency.
* Bondage/liberation imagery tied to Satan and darkness.
* Cooperation with God’s Spirit versus human effort.
* Kingdom theology (Light vs. Darkness, God’s Kingdom vs. Satan’s).

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest exhortational Lutheran-pietist tone.
* Direct address to conscience ("Kjære Brødre og Søstre!").
* Martial and eschatological urgency.
* Risk of modern softening of spiritual peril and responsibility.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "udråbe Naadens Aar" – proclamation language from Isaiah 61/Luke 4; KJV: "to proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD."
* "komme hjem til Faderhuset" – echo of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15).
* "Gjæster ved den store Nadvere" – Luke 14 (Great Supper).
* "Kongesønnens Bryllupsbord" – Matthew 22 (Wedding Feast of the King’s Son).
* "Satans Befæstninger" – Pauline warfare imagery (2 Corinthians 10:4).
* "Mørkets Borge" – Colossians 1:13 resonance.
* "Dødens Fanger" – Isaiah 61:1; Hebrews 2:15.
* "Skrifte, som snart kommer for os" – account before God; judgment imagery.

Literal translation risks:

* Reducing vivid proclamation verbs to neutral language.
* Rendering bondage imagery as metaphorical rather than spiritual reality.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: The present time is still the year of grace.
* Affirmation of opportunity: Doors are open; salvation is available.
* Missional urgency: Global readiness (languages known, Bible translated).
* Call to action: Spiritual warfare and obedience to God’s call.
* Rhetorical interrogation: What else are Christians for?
* Pastoral exhortation: Prayer for the Spirit, perseverance in mission.
* Conditional promise: Missionary obedience leads to divine blessing.
* Eschatological conclusion: Life is short; eternity is near.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Isaiah 61:1–2 / Luke 4:18–19 – year of grace, liberty to captives.
* Luke 15 – Father’s house.
* Luke 14 – Great Supper.
* Matthew 22 – Wedding of the King’s Son.
* 2 Corinthians 10:4–5 – strongholds.
* Colossians 1:13 – kingdom of darkness vs. light.
* Hebrews 12:28 – kingdom that cannot be shaken.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain urgency and seriousness of missed opportunity as "fearful responsibility."
* Preserve martial metaphors and calls to awaken.
* Retain direct address and earnest appeals.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "vilde være et forfærdeligt Ansvar" – must retain moral weight.
* Imperatives ("Vær derfor med") preserved as commands, not suggestions.
* Necessity grounded in divine calling, not human choice.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Naadens Aar – "the Year of Grace"
* Aand – "the Spirit"
* Rige – "Kingdom"
* Frelse – "salvation"
* Lys/Mørke – "Light/Darkness"

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Warfare, banquet, captivity, journey to eternity retained intact.
* No explanatory flattening of imagery.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Warning about responsibility balanced with promise of blessing.
* Severity toward negligence; consolation in God’s grace.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long periodic sentences preserved.
* Parallel infinitives and lists maintained.
* Rhetorical questions left intact.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Therefore we dare so boldly to proclaim the Year of Grace also this year. For still there is time, and still there is room for all who hear the Gospel to be saved and made blessed, to come home to the Father’s house, to become guests at the great Supper and at the wedding table of the King’s Son.

And precisely now the opportunity is so good and the doors so open, that it would be a fearful responsibility not to make use of the opportunity. Already missionaries are able to go forth, already the languages of the peoples are known and the Bible translated into their mother tongues. Truly it is high time that we awake and go forward with might against Satan’s strongholds and the fortresses of darkness. The Lord calls upon His host and commands it to go forth into the battle for the Kingdom of Light and for the cause of peace. What else are we Christians for, if not to follow the Lord’s call and to spread His Kingdom and His Gospel? Is not this our calling, is not this our task? At home and abroad it is the salvation of souls, eternal life, glory with God, which is the goal of every Christian’s life and labor.

Dear brothers and sisters! Pray the Lord for the Spirit, that He may in truth come upon us to drive us to proclaim the Year of Grace for poor heathen. They sit in bonds and imprisonment, under the oppressive yoke of heathendom; it is a blessed work to proclaim liberty to these captives of death and the opening of the prison to those bound by Satan. Therefore be with us with renewed earnestness, with greater steadfastness and perseverance! Let no day in the new year pass by without thought of the mission, without prayer for it! If we truly become a missionary people by the mighty assistance of God’s Spirit, not by the strength of our own resolutions, then we ourselves shall be blessed by the Lord, and He Himself will set us to be a blessing upon the earth.

Our life is not long, and the fleeting years remind us of the accounting we must soon render, from time into eternity. Would it not be good to make use of the few fleeting days we have for labor for the eternal Kingdom which is never shaken, the Kingdom of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ.
