STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "høie Træ / lavt Træ / tørt Træ / grønt Træ" – biblical metaphors (Ezekiel 17; Luke 23) requiring consistent figurative rendering.
* "Menighed" – must retain ecclesial weight as "congregation/church," not generalized "community."
* "Naade alene" – Reformation formula (sola gratia).
* "Dygtighed" – here not mere skill, but divinely granted sufficiency (cf. 2 Cor. 3:5).
* "Trælle" – servile instruments, not neutral workers.
* "evindelig" – eternally/forever; avoid weakening.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological pivots joined by semicolons.
* Parallel negations (not great enough / but small enough).
* Sermonic rhythm intended for oral proclamation.

Theological Hazards:

* Justification by grace alone; danger of moralizing.
* Divine sovereignty in election and mission.
* Proper distinction between God’s willing servants and unwilling instruments.
* Mission theology grounded in divine action, not human capacity.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, exhortational Lutheran tone.
* Strong contrasts (high/low, living/dead, dry/green).
* Direct address to conscience and missionary perseverance.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "gjør det høie Træ lavt og et lavt Træ høit" – Ezekiel 17:24; divine reversal.
* "det tørre Træ grønt" – Luke 23:31; resurrection imagery.
* "Syndere og Toldere" – Gospel shorthand for the despised yet redeemed.
* "Herren har Brug for os" – idiom of divine calling, not utility.
* "sukke ud efter Herren" – lamenting prayerful longing (cf. Ps. 42).
* "bli paa vor Frelses Gud" – trust/abide in God as Savior.

KJV-style equivalents are appropriate throughout.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Opening thesis: God reverses human hierarchies.
* Illustration: Church history and individual salvation.
* Doctrinal assertion: God alone gives life and usefulness.
* Warning: False righteousness leads to death.
* Application: True servants must be small and poor in themselves.
* Missionary encouragement: God can revive even the driest field.
* Concluding exhortation: Persevere in prayer, faith, and patience.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Ezekiel 17:22–24 – high and low trees.
* Luke 23:31 – dry and green tree.
* Matthew 9:12 – the sick needing a physician.
* Romans 11:33 – unsearchable judgments.
* Isaiah 59:1 – the Lord’s arm not shortened.
* John 8:35 – the servant not abiding forever.
* Matthew 28:19 / Acts 1:8 – mission to the ends of the earth.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain sharp contrasts and confident assertions.
* Preserve rebukes of self-sufficiency and unbelief.
* Retain missionary urgency and eschatological hope.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "maa / bør / kan ikke" rendered as must/ought/cannot.
* No weakening of necessity or divine resolve.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Menighed – Congregation
* Naade – Grace
* Tro – Faith
* Aand – Spirit
* Tjener / Redskab – Servant / Instrument

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Retain arboreal imagery throughout.
* Preserve vineyard and building metaphors.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity toward pride and unbelief.
* Consolation and hope toward the faithful.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where intentional.
* Semicolon logic retained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Once again it has proved true that the Lord maketh the high tree low and the low tree high; for the great and mighty societies of men have fallen, but the Lord has spread abroad and exalted His lowly congregation, so that from Jerusalem it has come even unto the uttermost ends of the earth.

And as with the congregation, so also with the individual. In the case of the poor, wretched sinner who is saved by grace alone, it is shown most gloriously that the Lord is He who maketh the dry tree green, while He maketh a green tree dry. For many a false Pharisee, who had no need of a physician, has become the prey of death, while sinners and publicans have received life through the faith of the Son of God.

Verily, God is a wondrous God, and His judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out!

When therefore we ask whether the Lord has any use for us in the service of His kingdom, in its victorious course over the earth, we ought to note this, both for our comfort and for our humiliation, that this is a question not of whether we are great enough, but whether we are small enough; not of whether we are rich enough, but whether we are poor enough. For the Lord cannot use others as His true servants and instruments than those who are so incapable in themselves that they will receive the sufficiency which is of God, which He gives by His Spirit. Only when the Lord Himself is allowed to fashion His instrument does the instrument become fit for His work. True it is that the Lord also uses the rebellious and proud powers of the world in His service; but it is against their will, and therefore they are used as bondservants, and “the bondservant abideth not in the house forever.” No, the Lord’s true handmaiden is His little congregation, His small believing children. They are small enough that the Lord can use them; were they great, they would glory in themselves and exalt their own name instead of the Lord’s.

This wondrous way of the Lord also gives us hope for our mission and for the heathen among whom the Lord has set us to labor. Verily, in our corner of the vineyard there grows only a low tree. So dead and dry is the heathen people to whom the Lord has sent us. Is it therefore in vain to labor? Yes, if we do our own work with our own power, then it is indeed beforehand certain that we labor in vain and can accomplish nothing. But the arm of the Lord is not shortened, and His hands have not become powerless. He can still make “a dry tree green,” and He will do it. Let us only “longing after the Lord, abide in the Lord our Savior.” For He is still the same and still walks the same wondrous way.

Only patience on our part! Listen not to the many unbelieving voices that sound around us, and perhaps even within us: There is nothing to be done in South Madagascar; the climate is so deadly, the people stand so low, it is of no use. Indeed it is of use; for the Lord will make “a low tree high,” that His name may be honored and made known among the peoples. Already we have seen the great works of the Lord on our mission field, and the Lord will yet further reveal Himself gloriously. Let us continue in prayer and faith, and the Lord shall yet create life out of the dead and build His congregation also in the darkest regions of Madagascar, to which He has sent us with the light of the Gospel.
