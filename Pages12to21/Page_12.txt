STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Missionens Værd" – value/worth with moral and theological weight, not mere usefulness.
* "Hedningemissionen" – mission to the heathen/Gentiles; carries biblical resonance (ethnē) and 19th‑century usage.
* "Sløvhed og Ligegyldighed" – spiritual torpor and indifference, not simple laziness.
* "bindselig" – foolishly, obtusely, with a moral edge.
* "retter jo aldrig frem" – never truly advances; idiomatic pessimism.
* "Udbytte" – yield/fruit, spiritually construed.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long sentences with semicolons and causal chains must be preserved.
* Rhetorical reasoning structured as objections and refutations.
* Embedded biblical quotation and paraphrase.

Theological Hazards:

* Conversion ("omvender sig"), salvation of the soul, faith in Jesus Christ.
* Valuation of a single soul over the whole world (Matt. 16:26 echo).
* Imitatio Christi: life given in response to Christ’s self‑giving.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational Lutheran sermon tone.
* Address to conscience; warning against spiritual dullness.
* Do not soften rebuke or urgency.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Den lille Tal vorde til tusinde" – Isa. 60:22; promise of divine multiplication.
* "det gaar sent" – progress appears slow; experiential complaint.
* "kan det være det samme" – then it makes no difference; fatalistic shrug.
* "efter den gamle Regel" – proverbial logic; human calculation opposed to faith.
* KJV provides natural equivalents for biblical echoes (Isaiah; Gospels).

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Observation: Many complain mission advances slowly.
* Diagnosis: Complaint used to excuse spiritual indifference.
* Exposure: A pseudo‑rational objection based on statistics.
* Refutation: From a Christian standpoint, the objection is false.
* Thesis reaffirmed: One soul saved justifies the mission’s cost.
* Climactic appeal: Christ’s self‑sacrifice demands ours.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Isaiah 60:22 quoted verbatim in heading.
* Matthew 16:26 / Mark 8:36 echoed: value of a soul vs. the world.
* Implicit Pauline and Johannine soteriology (faith in Christ; salvation).

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain rebuke of indifference.
* Maintain earnest exhortation without sentimentality.
* Preserve sharp contrast between human calculation and divine valuation.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "burde" – moral obligation retained as "ought".
* "kan det være det samme" – rendered with full dismissive force.
* Rhetorical questions preserved.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Hedning – heathen / Gentile (consistent).
* Sjæl – soul.
* frelst – saved.
* Tro – faith.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Numerical imagery (increase/decrease) preserved.
* Race/pace metaphor retained (one who goes before, one who follows).

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity in exposing objection.
* Consolation and elevation in valuing a single soul.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Semicolon pivots maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

\subsection{The Worth of the Mission}

“The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation; I, the LORD, will hasten it in its time.” Isa. 60:22.

There are many who think that the mission to the heathen goes forward but slowly. And they make use of this as an excuse for their own sloth and indifference. Properly, this very circumstance—that it goes slowly—ought rather to have the effect upon them that they labored with so much the greater zeal; but they take it in an altogether different manner and suppose that, when it goes so slowly, the whole work is of no consequence; it never truly advances in any case. At times some of these secret opponents of the mission deal quite foolishly with their contemplation of its slow progress and assert that it is simply an impossibility that the heathen should be converted; for, say they, there are born each year many more heathen than are baptized from among them; therefore the number of heathen increases far more rapidly than the number of heathen Christians, and thus it goes according to the old rule, that when he who goes before moves faster than he who follows after, the latter cannot overtake the former.

This objection against the mission to the heathen is at present very much in fashion and does great harm by dulling and blunting spiritual interest. It is therefore salutary to consider it and to see how much it truly amounts to.

Viewed from one side, a Christian will at once perceive that it is altogether wrong to listen to such talk. For so long as there is even one heathen who turns to God and has his soul saved through faith in Jesus Christ, so long is there yield enough from the mission to the heathen, even if it were to cost far more in human lives and money than it now costs. Or is not a soul worth more than “the whole world”? If God’s Son gave His life for us, why should not we give our life for Him?
