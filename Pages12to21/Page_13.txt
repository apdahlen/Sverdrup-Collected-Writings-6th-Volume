STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Missionens Mening og Forjættelse" – carries theological weight: not mere intention but divine promise.
* "Hedningesjæl" – singular soul language with pietistic resonance; avoid neutralizing.
* "Forjættelserne" – biblical promises; must retain covenantal tone.
* "Vantroens Fristelse" – temptation arising from unbelief; not simple doubt.
* "Menigheden" – church as gathered congregation, not abstract Christianity.
* "Tilsiger" – implies summons/implication, not merely suggests.
* "Virksomhed" – ecclesial ministry, not generic activity.
* "Spotterne" – biblical term (mockers/scoffers).

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with semicolon logic.
* Embedded quotations from Scripture.
* Argument unfolds cumulatively; avoid fragmentation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of mission grounded in divine promise, not human success.
* God’s faithfulness vs. human calculations.
* Accusation that denying mission’s possibility makes God a liar.

Voice Hazards:

* Solemn, exhortational, polemical tone.
* Address to conscience against unbelief and rationalism.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "fra Hav til Hav" – biblical idiom (Ps. 72:8); universal reign.
* "prise Gud for hans Barmhjertigheds Skyld" – Romans 15:9; KJV resonance needed.
* "gjør Gud til en Løgner" – 1 John 5:10 echo; retain sharpness.
* "Hvor bliver der af Forjættelsen om hans Tilkommelse?" – 2 Peter 3:4 quotation.
* "én Dag er for Herren som tusinde Aar" – 2 Peter 3:8; KJV phrasing.
* "Den lille skal vorde til tusinde" – Isaiah 60:22; prophetic cadence.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Thesis: Mission promises more than isolated conversions.
* Scriptural foundation: God promises universal expansion of His kingdom.
* Rebuttal: Unbelief claims mission is futile due to statistics.
* Counter-claim: Such unbelief denies God’s faithfulness.
* Expansion: True mission aims at established congregations.
* Climactic contrast: God’s reckoning vs. human reckoning.
* Conclusion: God’s ways appear opposite to human calculation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Psalm 72:8 – dominion from sea to sea.
* Matthew 24:14 – gospel preached to all nations.
* Romans 15:9 – Gentiles glorify God for mercy.
* 1 John 5:10 – making God a liar.
* 2 Peter 3:4, 8 – scoffers and divine time.
* Isaiah 60:22 – growth of the small into a mighty nation.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Retain direct accusation against unbelief.
* Preserve prophetic confidence and rebuke.
* Avoid softening impossibility claims.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" rendered as "shall" with full force.
* "vil" as divine volition.
* "er umuligt" preserved as absolute negation.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Forjættelse – promise.
* Guds Rige – Kingdom of God.
* Hedninger – Gentiles.
* Menighed – congregation/church (consistent).

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Numerical metaphors retained.
* Temporal contrast (day/thousand years) preserved.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Confidence vs. mockery.
* Human despair vs. divine assurance.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences maintained.
* Scriptural quotations allowed to breathe.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

But it is not the intent and promise of the mission merely that now and then a single heathen soul should be saved through the preaching of the Gospel. It is truly promised that the Kingdom of God shall be spread from sea to sea, wherever men dwell, and that the peoples, the nations, shall be received into it and find salvation and peace. All readers of the Bible know that such are the promises, and such also is the Lord’s command concerning the work which He desires to have carried out by His disciples. Therefore there lies in this manner of speech a temptation of unbelief: It avails nothing to engage in mission, for the heathen peoples increase more rapidly than the congregation. For the Lord has promised that the Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached unto all nations, and that the Gentiles shall glorify God for His mercy’s sake. If anyone therefore says that it is impossible to Christianize the peoples, he makes God a liar and denies the faithfulness of His promise.

The work of missions therefore aims not merely at gaining a soul saved here or there, but at gathering congregations of converted Gentiles who carry on the same ministry with the Word and the Sacraments as is now common in the so‑called Christian lands. And it is this latter aim which unbelief holds to be impossible according to statistical calculations.

But God’s way of reckoning is not as the way of men. When the scoffers come with their reckoning of time and say, Where is the promise of His coming? then He answers: But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. — And when the scoffers come with their statistics and censuses and say, It goes too slowly; the Kingdom of God will never reach unto the ends of the earth; then the Lord answers: The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation; I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time.

In other words, human calculations and human statistics do not accord with the Lord’s way of advancing His work. At times it sounds to us as though the Lord’s way and manner were precisely the opposite of our own.
