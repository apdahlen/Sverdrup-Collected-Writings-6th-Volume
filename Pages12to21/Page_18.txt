STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Kaldet" – vocational/divine calling, not mere invitation.
* "Aand" – Spirit; must retain personal, divine sense.
* "Drivkraft" – inner compulsion, not mechanical force.
* "Mission" – proclamation and redemptive action, not modern NGO sense.
* "Naadens Aar" – Jubilee/grace year with biblical resonance.
* "Menighed" – church/congregation in militant sense.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with theological buildup.
* Semicolon logic and rhetorical progression.
* Embedded Scripture quotations requiring cadence preservation.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of Spirit’s indwelling and agency.
* Union between Christ and believers.
* Mission as continuation of Christ’s work.
* Salvation-history framing (time of grace).

Voice Hazards:

* Sermonic exhortation and address to conscience.
* Earnest, confessional Lutheran tone.
* Avoid modern smoothing or dilution of urgency.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "Kristi Kjærlighed tvinger os" – echo of 2 Cor. 5:14 (KJV: "the love of Christ constraineth us").
* Isaiah passage corresponds to Isa. 61:1–2, rendered close to KJV diction.
* "stridende Menighed" – church militant, not merely suffering.
* "vældig Basunrøst" – eschatological trumpet imagery.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Divine calling arises from the Spirit’s inward compulsion.
* This calling is summed up in the word "Mission."
* Mission is defined biblically through Isaiah’s prophecy.
* Objection raised: this is Christ’s work alone.
* Answer: believers are called to continue Christ’s work.
* Grounded in Christ’s promise (John 14:12–13).
* Explained through living union between Christ and believers.
* Applied to New Year as present time of grace and salvation.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Isaiah 61:1–2 (mission of the anointed servant).
* John 14:12–13 (greater works through Christ’s ascension).
* 2 Corinthians 5:14 (constraining love of Christ).
* 2 Corinthians 6:2 ("now is the accepted time").

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain exhortational urgency.
* Preserve direct address and rhetorical questions.
* Retain uncompromising claim about salvation of sinners.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "skal" → shall/must.
* "vil" → divine intention, not mere possibility.
* Avoid weakening commands or promises.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Aand → Spirit
* Kjærlighed → love (divine/agape context)
* Mission → Mission
* Naade → grace
* Frelsens Dag → day of salvation

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Trumpet imagery retained.
* Ascending/descending Spirit imagery preserved.
* Kingdom citizenship metaphor retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Instruction → objection → affirmation → consolation → urgency.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences preserved where rhetorically intentional.
* Biblical cadence favored over modern prose.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Thus comes the Call. For the Spirit is a spiritual driving power which unceasingly urges forward the cause of the Kingdom of God and takes into His service all those whose hearts He fills with the love of God. If we are driven by the Spirit of God, then the love of Christ constrains us to go where the Lord sends us, and to perform what He commands us.

And if we are to sum up all that the Lord commands us in a single word, then it is this: Mission. For this, at least for our part, is what we mean by Mission, as Isaiah says: “to preach good tidings unto the meek; to bind up the brokenhearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.”

Yes, you will say, but this is the work of Jesus that is here described! Yes, it is; but are not the followers of Jesus to do the works of Jesus? Most certainly; He says it Himself: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto My Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

There is a real and living connection between Jesus and His believers. He sits at the right hand of the Father in glory, and His disciples are here below on earth in the Church militant; but the Spirit ascends, and the Spirit of God is sent down, and with the Spirit there follows light and power to do the work of God and of our Lord Jesus Christ upon the earth.

The New Year which we celebrate reminds us in a special way of this one thing which in truth comprehends all: “to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” This means first and foremost that now is the time to preach the Gospel upon the earth; and so long as the Gospel is preached, and as often as it is preached, it shall sound with the voice of a mighty trumpet among the peoples: Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation! Yes, precisely now; for the Gospel is preached precisely when God wills, and precisely where God wills. And He wills nothing else thereby than to save sinners and to make them citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven.
