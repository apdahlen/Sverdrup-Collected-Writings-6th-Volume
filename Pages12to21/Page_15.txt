STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Hedning" / "Hedenskabet" – carries theological weight (paganism, heathenism) and must not be softened.
* "Daabsundervisning" – catechetical instruction prior to baptism; not generic teaching.
* "Forjættelse" – biblical promise; must retain scriptural resonance.
* "Vækkelsens Ild" – revival fire; metaphorical and biblical.
* "opbrænder" – burns up; judgment and purifying imagery.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long compound sentences with rhetorical questions.
* Paratactic structure typical of sermonic prose.
* Quoted Scripture embedded within argument.

Theological Hazards:

* Doctrine of faith as sole decisive factor.
* Divine sovereignty over mission growth (“Herrens Time”).
* Eschatological confidence in God’s promise.

Voice Hazards:

* Earnest, exhortational tone addressing doubt.
* Polemical confidence against rationalistic calculation.
* Sermonic cadence must not be flattened.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "tager Fart" – gains momentum; metaphor of movement.
* "spaar den vel eller ilde" – whether one predicts good or ill; idiomatic dismissal of human prognostication.
* "Regnestykker" – od
ulations; stands for human statistical reasoning opposed to divine action.
* Biblical allusion to Isaiah 60:22 (“A little one shall become a thousand”). KJV diction is appropriate.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Empirical missionary testimony (Livingstone Mission).
* Generalization to other mission fields.
* Rhetorical refutation of claim that Christianity cannot overcome paganism.
* Contrast between slow beginnings and rapid Spirit-driven expansion.
* Climactic appeal to faith in divine promise.
* Scriptural confirmation as final authority.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* Isaiah 60:22 explicitly quoted.
* Imagery of fire recalls Acts 2 and prophetic judgment motifs.
* Star imagery evokes Numbers 24:17 and general biblical guidance symbolism.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* Maintain confidence and polemical edge.
* Do not soften ridicule of human calculation.
* Preserve exhortational certainty.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* "kan der da være Tale om" – rhetorical impossibility.
* "skal vorde" – strong future certainty.
* "vil lade det hastigt ske" – divine determination.

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Hedning / Hedenskab = heathen / heathenism.
* Tro = faith.
* Forjættelse = promise.
* Herren = the Lord.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Fire, star, growth imagery retained without explanation.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* From narrative reporting to sharp rhetorical challenge.
* From human doubt to divine assurance.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Retain long sentences and rhetorical flow suitable for proclamation.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (FINAL)

Concerning the Livingstone Mission in Central Africa it is related that it required six years of labor before a single heathen was baptized. When it was nine years old, it had nine baptized, believing members of the congregation. Now it is twenty-seven years old, and more than fifteen hundred have been baptized, and there are thousands in instruction for baptism.

And from other mission fields there come reports of the same kind. How then can it be said that it is impossible for Christianity to overcome heathenism? If it goes slowly in the beginning, it goes all the faster once it has gained momentum. Those who reckon that more heathens are born than are baptized—what good it their reckoning when the fire of revival begins to burn, as now in Madagascar, and the Lord burns up both heathenism and the reckonings?

There is only the one thing that matters: faith. It holds fast to the divine promise; it goes straight forward with its gaze fixed upon the shining star of the promise, and whether one predicts for it good or ill, it is steadfast in its purpose. When the Lord’s hour comes, then it goes in every place and among every heathen people as He Himself has said: The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation; I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time.
