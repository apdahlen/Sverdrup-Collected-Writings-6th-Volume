STEP 1: HAZARD IDENTIFICATION

Lexical Hazards:

* "Bevis-ning i Ordenen" (archaic orthography): denotes authoritative teaching/attestation in doctrine, not mere argumentation.
* "haard Tale": biblically charged phrase (cf. John 6:60), must retain severity.
* "drage alle til sig": Johannine theological idiom (John 12:32).
* "Fornedrelsen": humiliation/abasement with Christological depth (Phil. 2).
* "Hvedekornet": fixed biblical metaphor (John 12:24).
* "Næreise": older form of "næring" meaning sustenance/life-giving vitality.

Syntactic Hazards:

* Long periodic sentences with multiple subordinations; breaking them risks flattening sermonic cadence.
* Em-dash pivots and semicolons mark rhetorical turns that must be preserved.

Theological Hazards:

* Christ’s withdrawal and offense as deliberate means of salvation.
* The paradox of growth through loss; divine sovereignty in mission.
* Seed–death–fruit imagery central to Lutheran theology of the cross.

Voice Hazards:

* Exhortational, contemplative tone addressed to believing conscience.
* Modern smoothing would erase gravity and biblical resonance.

STEP 2: IDIOM ANALYSIS

* "sætte ham til Konge": echoes John 6:15; political messianism.
* "haard Tale": John 6:60; discourse that tests faith.
* "Vil ogsaa I gaa bort?": John 6:67 (KJV cadence preferred).
* "de forlod ham alle og flyede": Mark 14:50 (KJV wording).
* "Hvedekornet": John 12:24; death as condition of fruitfulness.
* Gideon’s army: Judges 7; divine victory through reduction.
* Isaiah 60:22 quoted; KJV diction should be echoed.

STEP 3: ARGUMENT STRUCTURE IDENTIFICATION

* Example of Christ’s method: withdrawal at the height of popularity.
* Paradox: alienation as means of drawing all.
* Fulfillment through death, resurrection, Pentecost.
* General principle: God strengthens by taking away.
* Biblical corroboration: Gideon.
* Historical corroboration: mission history.
* Experiential climax: sudden turning and abundant harvest.

STEP 4: BIBLICAL ECHO IDENTIFICATION

* John 6; John 12; Mark 14; Isaiah 60; Judges 7.
* KJV phrasing retained where recognizable.

STEP 5: VOICE INTENSITY PRESERVATION

* No softening of offense, abandonment, or death.
* Maintain earnest, contemplative seriousness.

STEP 6: MODAL FORCE PRESERVATION

* Necessity and divine determination rendered with firm modals ("must," "would").

STEP 7: CONSISTENT THEOLOGICAL TERM RENDERING

* Fornedrelse = humiliation/abasement.
* Forsoning = atonement.
* Frelse = salvation.

STEP 8: METAPHOR INTEGRITY PRESERVATION

* Seed imagery preserved verbatim.
* Military reduction imagery retained.

STEP 9: TONE CONTRAST PRESERVATION

* Severity → desolation → hope → abundance.

STEP 10: ORAL CADENCE AWARENESS

* Long sentences and rhythmic buildup maintained.

STEP 11: ACADEMIC TRANSLATION (VOICE-PRESERVING)

Take, for example, Jesus’ manner of working in His last days.

When His following began to grow, and many joined themselves to Him; when He began to become “popular” through mighty works and authoritative power of His words; when the crowds grew great and would have made Him king—then He not only withdrew and vanished from the enthusiastic multitude, but He even returned to the people and spoke “hard words” to them, so that they turned away from Him and would follow Him no longer. And so strong did this movement away from Jesus become that He even asked the Twelve: Will ye also go away?—and yet He was fully resolved upon this, to “draw all unto Himself.” And in order to accomplish this, He thus drove all from Him, in that He went so deeply into shame and suffering that none were with Him and none dared to follow Him; “they all forsook Him, and fled,” says Mark. But Jesus went into humiliation and suffering and death alone, that He might become the grain of wheat which falls into the earth and dies, that it may bear much fruit. And when He then rose from the dead and ascended into heaven and sent the Spirit upon the disciples, then the multitude grew in wondrous wise according to the Lord’s good pleasure, and the prophetic word was fulfilled which says: The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation; I the LORD will hasten it in its time.

This is the Lord’s way. He does not always increase the strength of His host by adding; often He multiplies its power by taking away. Who does not remember Gideon’s army of two and thirty thousand men, of whom the LORD said: The people that are with thee are too many? And they were not few enough until they were but a mere three hundred men; then the victory was theirs.

This manner of the Lord’s working has revealed itself again and again in the history of missions. He lets His servants labor long; He wearies them; He lets them die upon the mission field without seeing visible results by human measure. But when the seed has vanished into the earth and been moistened with tears, at times with blood, then it sprouts; and one day there comes shoot upon shoot and blade upon blade, and the whole field grows green at once, so that it is a wonder before our eyes of life and nourishment.

It is not one mission, but it is well-nigh all missions, that have this experience: that the first beginning was small, poor, almost despairing. It seemed impossible to reach the hearts of the people. They would hear with the ears, none—or almost none—with the heart. Year after year passed; no change showed itself. Hope was awakened and again extinguished. When then all patience was on the point of breaking, the turning came: one soul sought the Lord until it found Him as its Savior; the first heathen was baptized. And from that hour, things changed. One came, and again another; many, and still more, came and sought salvation in that atonement which is in Jesus Christ. And the little one became a thousand, and the small one a mighty nation.
